1,"Our stay at this amazing was beyond all our expectations. The service levels standards
and detail to service was beyond all our expectations. From the time we arrived to the time we left both management and staff were incredible. Facilities and amenities of the highest standard",1
2,"It was a pleasure staying at the Taj Exotica. The hotel is laid out over a mix of lush greens in the front and dense landscaping around the villa rooms. Food is excellent throughout. We had a great meal at Li Bai and at Miguel, we got a great demo of excellent Italian food. Children's activities are an integral part of the experience. Very unlike a small 'kids play area' as in most hotels, TEX KIDS as they call it is a mini playschool by itself. They run 2-3 different activities plus a movie every day. For the grownups, there are yoga sessions, dance classes and enough sports options to last a fortnight! Archery, golf and cricket are standouts. A special mention of Jai at Eugenia, Shailesh at Li Bai, Rakesh, the yoga instructor and finally, Kunal at the front desk.",1
3,"The best part about this hotel is that it truly demonstrates the humble yet sound service culture of Taj, one of the world's finest hotel companies. Every bit of the hotel has their distinct stamp and the property is one of the most well-maintained that we have seen - given that it is not brand new! Lets look at all aspects:

1. Rooms - are spacious with all amenities that you may need. Just the perfect gardens behind the balconey (ground level works best for that)
2. Housekeeping - very prompt, never say no attitude. Turndown of course is a given in such properties.
3. Breakfast - elaborate spread, all cuisines, many options, works best for kids who may or may not stick to one cuisine. Surprisingly, the live counters were super quick and efficient .. no delays reported by anyone .. a lot of staff members available, which can be annoying if you just want to sit and eat without someone asking ""do you want something"" .. having said that, turnaround is super quick.
4. Beach - clean, less crowded, very fine sand, safe, well-serviced.
5. Pool - quite big .. leela kovalam was better because it was an infinity pool . but this one has a separate spacious kids pool and guess what, a water slide for them .. addictive!
6. Restaurants - all of them are wonderful .. excellent chefs and recipes .. 2 restaurants (Eugenia & Miguel Arcanjo - a celebrity chef from Taj Palace, Bombay) are dedicated to specific personalities and that makes them special .. Li Bai oriental cuisine was awesome, with a pepper icecream as well.. Lobster Shack had a good sizzler offering + catch of the day in excellent ambience of the beach
7. Activities - a lot of options like Archery, Cycling, indoor games, Tennis, Yoga Center, Spa, Golf, Cricket, etc. I have waited for a long time in other hotels for the Golf Carts but here it was quite efficiently managed .. except for once or twice, the carts were well on time and quick to attend.
8. Kids play area - staffed with 2 ladies, with activities everyday, movie screenings, slides and other games
9. Location - we did not leave this hotel even once in the 5 days that we were there .. so not sure if the location is good or bad :)
10. Business Center - i had to use it for some work, very well made peaceful place, good connectivity, excellent board room

So overall, 5 relaxing days .. always a busy property but still not chaotic .. very peaceful .. smooth service .. no hiccups .. when the staff is always eager to help.

I need to mention Mr. Manoj Mishra and his team led by Mr. Narayan who made the stay comfortable for us.
Also the front desk team, the check-in process started from Airport and as we entered the hotel, everyone was prepared for our check-in which means they were all informed about our arrival, pickup, timing of alighting at the hotel, etc.

So no cribs, no complaints. Make sure you bicycle through the property, spend enough time on the beach & pool and have some non-buffet exotic dishes at their restaurants.

Spoilt for now.",1
4,"We stayed at this hotel as a 3 night extension to a guided tour of India. We travelled with Voyages Jules Verne (VJV), the whole trip was a fantastic experience. We had spent the previous night at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai and were very disappointed with our experience there - it did not live up to our expectations; a separate review will be posted of our stay there.
From the minute we arrived at the Taj Exotica everything was magical. We were greeted with a welcome drink and, as we were early, we sat in the bar for about 40 minutes until our room was ready. The service throughout the stay was impeccable. We were driven to our room in a little buggy. Our room was enormous yet cosy and comfortable. Our VJV tour guide who had met us at the airport even rang after 1 hour to check that we had settled in ok. Our room had its own garden area and included a hammock for relaxing in the shade. The first night we dined at the Lobster Shack overlooking the beach and a very helpful waiter, Flavian, helped us select our main course from the live seafood in the tank. He even recognised us when we went to the bar the following morning for our 11am drink and knew our room number and what we liked to drink - outstanding service!
We were also looked after very well by Chayanika in the buffet restaurant. We were only there 3 nights but she made an effort to get to know us and always found us a good table to sit at. I recommend the Kathi Kebab for lunch and the Dosa for breakfast- extremely tasty! It was surprising to see some European tourists sticking to very plain food - they were missing out on so much.We did not eat at any of the speciality restaurants as the food in the buffet restaurant was so good. The fresh Mango juice was delicious and all the food was cooked form products that were in season.
The grounds surrounding the hotel are green and full of flowers. There is a small course and cricket matches arranged most afternoons. The swimming pool was clean and at 4pm every day we were given free ice creams - a nice touch. You can also sit on the beach; the sea is warm and was fun to swim in as it has some waves. Pool towels are plentiful and the security guards check you in and out as you walk down to the beach. 
This hotel is so good that we have already booked to go back next year and have persuaded friends to join us. I just hope we get the same room as it was in a perfect location.It is unusual for us to go somewhere more than once so this tells you how good it is. This is quite possibly the best hotel in the world!",1
5,"service is quick. clean room, tasty food. ambience is beautiful. went with frnds. stayed here for few days, people can stay with their family or frnds. beautiful places nearby. it is located in benaulim,",1
6,"Fabulous property, well maintained, good and helping staff. From 20 May 2016 we stayed in this property for four nights. Staff is excellent, they are there to help u all the times, housing keeping is prompt. Front desk and business center staff are helpful that they make ur stay comfortable. Lot of choices in food, staff in restaurants are so nice they treat u like ur at home. Somehow I forgotten my specs at swimming fool area next day they returned to me, nice people, u can trust them. They provide electric car for in house transport, drivers of the same are so good they always enquire u for drop. Special mentioned about one driver Mr. Sanju he was so cooperative and helpful. All this make our stay excellent and we enjoyed lot. This is place worth visiting, and we will definitely visit again.

7,"First we like to start by saying this is a fabulous resort. Our experience could not have been better. From friendly staff, to exotic foods from all the restaurants onsite. We so enjoyed the wonderful grounds keeping, which was immaculate. Although, we have found that the bedding situation (mattresses) mainly seem to be the desired style for the east continent with firmness, being they are not so comfortable. However manageable. Anyhow, it was a vacation worth mentioning on the trip advisor site. We went during off season but this was not a major concern as there is plenty to do on the grounds with activities being offered by the resort. The children can be kept busy at Tex kids, and there is a variety everyday for the children. Bicycling, archery, tennis, table tennis, are just a few to mention to keep those minds going. There is not a babysitting system available so if you bring smaller children you must manage with them during activities. Overall, we had a pleasant experience at this resort and if we come back to India, we may return to Goa at the Tal",1
8,"Wonderful place. Super spacious. Comfortable villas. Food is above average and can be better. One of the must visit places in the quiet areas of Goa. Away from the usual Goa tourist traffic. Best time to visit : winters 
The staff is good and very helpful.",1
9,It was a very good experience in that resort. When you entered they will treat you like queen or king or else prince n princess. They will not only to take of you but they are there whenever you needed them to be there. Otherwise u have your own spece especially for couple. You must visit it once you will definitely enjoy it. N the food was too delicious. Very neat n clean the looby area n all over the resort.,1
10,"The hotel location is just fantastic. The staff, right from those who welcome you to those who help you for breakfast, at your rooms, at the pool, at various restaurants and those who help you check out, are just amazingly wonderful people.

11,"We stayed at this exotic place for 2 nights in August.
This is a wonderful property ; 140 rooms spread over green 56 acres of well maintained landscaped garden.

The property has tennis court,Golf course,cricket,Table tennis ,archery etc activities.

The lobby is huge with excellent ambience and has pool tables.

The rooms are clean,spacious,well maintained with flat TV screen,working desk,safe,spacious bed with balanced hardness/softness of mattress.
The bathroom has shower area as well as bathtub.

The property has swimming pool and bicycles are available on complimentary for total 2 hours per room.
It would have been great if bicycles are provided on complimentary basis for the entire duration of the stay rather than 2 hours per day.

The staff is outstanding in terms of hospitality.
The staff across main entrance,main desk,restaurants,activity desk,housekeeping,beach access gate is warm,polite and eager to assist you for your needs.

There is a direct access to the beach which is manned and towels are provided at the access gate.The beach is very clean and guarded.

The restaurant has amazing food with daily change in menus and live counter serving different delicacies.

We enjoyed every moment of our stay.Would like to return next time to stay for more number of nights.

Overall a amazing relaxing experience!!!

12,"Can a hotel surpass itself? It can. This is my second visit and the third for my wife and each time the experience has surpassed itself. 
The property is beautiful, maintained with care and love. The lawns are neat and the pool is always sparkling. The rooms are tastefully done with a subtle touch.
But what is striking, and this is true of every single Taj property is the quality of their service. It goes beyond routine and touches your heart with warmth.
The checkin is super efficient and amazingly courteous with Siddharth Jain leading the way.
What amazes you again is the personalised service in the restauraunts. While everyone was great, I would like to mention Mr Ganga, who with his care and attentiveness feel really welcome , every single day. Words cannot describe his talent and skill. Mr David and Aslam were good as well and the ability of the restauraunt manager, Mr Sailesh ( sorry if I have got the name wrong) to supervise with a smile was amazing. He demonstrated great ability to make you feel wanted and wanting to return again.
The housekeeping was wonderful, silent yet superbly efficient.

Keep it up Taj Exotica. You are the best in Goa and ofcourse we will be back again next year. Hope you continue to do well...it would be difficult to be better than what you already are because you have set such great standards for yourself.",1
13,"Short Version:
Beautiful property, Amazing hospitality with attention to minutest of details, Great food, Clean and private beach

Long Version:
This was our second visit to a Taj property. Taj, I believe spoils you, you get used to highest standards in hospitality and luxury. When expectations are this high, there is always a chance that you can get disappointed. Taj Exotica even beats such high levels of expectations! :)

Amazingly beautiful and expansively green property! They have great food options. Their private beach is clean and a great experience.

If you have read this far enough, I don't think so you ll need additional convincing. Go there and check out what the fuss is about Taj Hospitality! You ll be surprised, pleasantly and happily :)",1
14,"Excellent ambiance, very good property, well appointed rooms, very well maintained lush green lawns. Overall an experience of a life time.. It was my second visit there. There was a special occasion for which we received very memorable surprises from the hotel sid.",1
15,"My husband and I stayed at the Taj Exotica in March this year for 6 days. I stayed previously with several friends at Park Hyatt 2 days (see my review).
At first I was a little disappointed because, compared to Hyatt, the hotel seemed deserted.
But in short time I realized that, in fact, the hotel was offering the extra peace and relaxation we needed before we returned home to our usual activities.
The hotel (at the same level rooms) was much luxurios and the gardens more manicured.
The golf course is well maintained. Pool, beach very clean and quiet.
The staff is very attentive, courteous and eager to serve you and help you.
Breakfast was impeccable.
We dined at the resort's restaurants only three times. In the first two evenings we ate in two restaurants nearly empty. When I saw the prices, I realised why. They were much biger than at the other very good restaurants in India. Most of the hotel guests ate often at restaurants near the hotel owned by locals or at the Lobster Shack, one of the hotel's restaurant that was very good. We had lunch there several times and dinner in the last evening of our stay.
We remember with pleasure our stay at the Taj Exotica and, if my husband and I will wish again to come in Goa for relaxation and a wonderful and peaceful place, we will definitely return.",1
16,"One of the best luxury hotels in Goa . Though it is little bit costly but mind blowing experience u will get here . The welcome by the hotel staff was too good. The rooms are absolutely fantastic . This hotel provides u great services including laundry , wifi , spa , bar , swimming pool , gym and so many others . The food is also good but Indian food is not too much good . Overall it was a very nice experience staying here . But one problem is that it is not in the middle of the Goa city so markets are far away from this hotel .

Stayed August 2016, travelled with family",1
17,"I stayed here for three nights. The cottages are lovely. The property is green and facing the beach. It's perfect for families with young kids or couples. We were there on a work trip. The property has many outdoor activities; football, cricket, golf, cycling, archery, super swimming pool. 
Service and food are excellent. The rooms are a bit old now but nothing to complain about. Can't wait for the new renovated rooms which will be available this season.
The property faces the beach. You can take a walk at the Pristine Goa shore or simply laze in your room.
The Jiva spa is a must visit and free yoga sessions are good too.
Perfect relaxation!! ",1
18,We have chosen Taj Exotica to celebrate my 60th birthday alongwith two more birthdays in family. The experience was beyond our expectations. The Taj people made our celebration a memorable occation with all thier personalized services and hospitality. Taj is Taj one must say.,1
19,"Taj Exotica is the flagship resort of the Taj Hotels group and it really lives up to its reputation as being a flagship resort. We took a family vacation to the hotel and stayed at one of their villas with the plunge pools. And the experience did not let us down one bit. From the arrival at the airport itself when we were provided a car to get to the resort (very helpful driver named Abdul), to the check in at the hotel...everything was handled extremely professionally and smoothly. The hotel itself was amazing...right on a wonderful beach (and quite a clean, uncluttered beach as well), with so many activities that you just don't have to leave the property to enjoy. The staff at the hotel was wonderful. Extremely courteous, and helpful, everybody made sure that our stay at the hotel was comfortable. Special mention needs to made here of the staff at Li Bai restaurant, who took special pains to cater to the different tastes of me and my wife (I like my food to be a bit spicy while she wanted a completely non-spicy dish). The chef (Mr. Rawat) was also extremely nice. The other staff, at the buffet (especially the chefs at the live counters who made all the wonderful stuff for me...double thumbs up), and the staff the children's center, and generally everybody was wonderful. I would rate the hotel and the experience as one of the best (if not the best) that I have experienced...and would love to come back again and stay there longer. If the staff at the hotel read this...thanks to all of you guys for making our stay so pleasant! Keep up the good work!",1
20,It was a great tym there is really loved it i hope to go there again??? and we really enjoyed our stay there....and I would say more people should go there and I am sure they will enjoy their tym ......thank u for ur service ....,1
21,It's always great coming back to the Exotica... their staff is warm and friendly and they remember each request you have ever had! They welcome us with custom made surprises and the fact that it's DOG FRIENDLY and fabulously LUXURIOUS makes it the perfect vacay spot!,1
22,"The local Goan cuisine restaurant is really really brilliant. The hotel is spread out and provides optimum privacy and serenity. A perfect place if you wish to disconnect for a few days, from routine.",1
23,"I can recommend very highly this hotel . Everything is perfect and the staff and the surrounding are excellent. Garden, beach, etc. are I must say the best in South Goa. During the season the tourists will enjoy the shack on the beach which is a must during the day or Sunset for a cocktail and dinner. You can select your own sea food and very fresh.",1
24,I had visited this hotel on the holiday trip of my company then I checked in and this hotel had a great employees and their services are excellent they will provide good food so I suggest every one when you go to goa their it has a very luxurious swimming pool please check into this place,1
25,"If you visit the goa to spend your holiday then you can visit the TAJ EXOT to spend your holiday with bast of cost, I told you if you visit the taj, then it is the best moment of your life , I believe it is true.",1
26,"We planned our Family get-together at Taj Exotica Goa, this year, We had cousins
from all over India, Nepal coming to Taj Exotica. We stayed from 6th to 9th August 2016. We were welcomed by a welcome song, they gave us scented towels to refresh ourselves. We stayed in room no. 524, nice spacious rooms, with a balcony, Bathroom with tub and Bath area. Few Apples and Banana in the room, nice computer table and chair. Separate fridge with cool drink, beer available. Coffee, Tea, Green, German tea, coffee, water bottles are available. Forest essentials Aloe Verra, soaps, body lotion, shampoo were excellent. took a few home. :) 1st Day we checked in at around 3:30 pm, and had a late Lunch, Chicken Katti Rolls and Biriyani. We entered our rooms, and took rest the 1st Day.. We had special Goan Dance program by the Staff of Taj which was enjoyed by Grace & Samantha, then we had a our 1st dinner Buffet with the family. 
Day - 2 - 7th August 2016, Got up early, to have my jog by the Beach, Cool breeze, the sound of the waves, the staff wish us Good Morning!. Had my morning coffee, devotion at our room. enjoyed the Buffet breakfast, Ham Bacon, Chicken sausage, pork sausage, Boiled fish, cut fruits, regular south Indian food, Varieties for Mousse cake, Dosais, special omlete, and many more. After breakfast the kids enjoyed the time with the cycles. We had a time for photos with the entire group. After the cycle ride, we got into the large swimming pool, which has a slide for Kids. We played volleyball, throwball in the pool with all the cousins until 12 noon, took bath to be ready for Lunch.. Enjoyed the variety of food items, and went for our afternoon nap.. slept till 4pm.

There is Cycles for all ages, 3 to 60. My kids enjoyed the cycling. After breakfast hit the swimming pool with family.",1
27,"We usually visit Goa every year to visit friends and to relax for 2 weeks. We always visit this property for lunch, and to have a drink by the pool. We are always impressed that the staff remember us even though we only visit once a year.
Grounds are immaculate, and there is direct access to a prestige beach.
Prices are more expensive than the norm for Goa, but good value nonetheless.",1
28,"One of the best Taj hotels across the country. Exotica is located at South Goa - Prime location. Has a massive builtup and resort area. 

(+)
Very nicely built. 
Massive garden area
Private beach
Refreshing architecture 
Very good food
High standard of hospitality 

(-)
Located far off from North Goa, where actual Goa action takes place",1
29,"Stayed here after a tour of northern India for some relaxation and we couldn't have chosen a more perfect place! The staff couldn't do enough for you, very friendly but remaining professional. The facilities were superb with a spa and activity centre, and a fantastic range of restaurants covering all cuisines. The bar area was delightful with a great range of drinks on offer and a daily 'special'. Golf course, pool, beach, all very well tended. It was an extremely relaxing stay and everything was of the highest quality, which is why it is very popular with Bollywood stars and Indian sports stars. Some guests clearly chose to eat and drink outside the hotel every day on the cheap, not sure why you'd stay in a beautiful hotel like this with fantastic restaurants to then trail out for standard fayre and cheap booze.",1
30,Absolutely lovely hotel. Would come again. Very nice room.. courteous staff and well managed. Lovely hotel to stay and good rate according to hotel brand name. Front office staff are friendly and smiling face.,1
31,Great relaxing stay at this Taj hotel. Service is great and rooms comfortable and clean. The hotel is undergoing a refurbishment and the rooms are beginning to look a little tired - especially the bathrooms.,1
32,"We stayed one night at Taj Exotica and since we checked in until we checked out everything was just perfect. Hotel staff is very friendly, polite and always smiling. We used the Spa for a couple massage and it was a wonderful experience. We had the Tea timing at the swimming pool and it was very nice. The amenities of the hotel are just breathtaking and the garden something to be seen. I really recommend this hotel.",1
33,"Perfect Luxury that was reasonably priced. Perfect location, serene beauty with lush green landscape. Great Spa, Easy beach access with all bells & whistles. Will certainly recommend this place to friends & family. Thank you to ALL the staff members & Management for a great experience.",1
34,"This is the fourth time, I have stayed at a Taj hotel. This is the fourth time I can say the service has bee. Excellent. The food was also in all restaurants fantastic. I can only congratulate your hotel on the very high standards. I particularly want to praise Santosh who every night cleaned our room. His politeness and proactive approach was excellent. Also your buggy drivers were all helpful and indeed security who were increditwhen by mother in law thought she had lost her bracelet. The effort tak n to look for it was more than one would expect. Finally I think his name is Sathivraj. He was always very helpful at breakfast. I know how busy you are but I e had a large family and three Kodachrome need 5, two weeks need 2. He always helped broker my things. It is unfair to name individuals however, as I have to say that all staff have been a excellent. Eg I could add Ashton at the Lobster Shack. The list is endless. 
The only criticism I have is that the room bathrooms could do with a little modernising. They look a little dated now. 

However otherwise it has been a fantastic stay. ",1
35,"Just back from a 4 night holiday to this property. The place is amazing, wonderful blend of nature & luxury. There is a renovation in progress but u wouldn't even notice. Stayed in the luxury sunset view villa with private pool which was very nice although the bathroom was a bit dated. The air conditioned area of the restaurant should have more tables & the buffet should have more non vegetarian options for meat / seafood lovers like us. Staff is very attentive, helpful & cater to all your whims & fancies, u can't go wrong with this place - just go for it!!

Stayed May 2016, travelled with family

36,"This was our fist stop over in Asian holiday.it was an placenta stay in taj.very friendly staff little bit disappointed on front desk but over all we enjoyed.room is very big and big flat screen tv perfect.
Huge breakfast on buffet thank you very much",1
37,The hotel is a mini Goa by itself..beautiful locale..good food..friendly staff..overtly a pleasure stay...away from the maddening crowd of North Goa...pure rest in a clean environment...if you are looking for a holiday for self or gifting someone a royal holiday this is the place to stay,1
38,"After reading all the excellent reviews we stayed there for 2 nights, and the experience was GOOD but not EXCELLENT. We were made to wait for more than 1.5 hours to get the room even when we were travelling with an infant and were staying at the pool villa, The booking we got online was without breakfast, and when we asked the Front office folks to give us some package for meals ( like Breakfast + Dinner ) etc which is common at Goa, we were replied with a NO. there was no flexibility no WOW factor offered to us. My 3 year old daughter asked for welcome drink but was not offered by the steward who was serving to other adults. That was quite unacceptable behavior. The Property is good its massive. Humongous Swimming pool and Green areas are there to welcome all guests. There are Kids activities as well to keep the little ones busy. The food is OK but is SUPER EXPENSIVE. There is no discount for the in house guests as well. A property which could have easily been rated 5* had they focused just a bit on Customer service.",1
39,"We visited for 4 days in Mid April, to attend a wedding celebration, and found the Taj to be a spectacular property with stunning grounds, and access to a beautiful beach. Most of the rooms are large bungalows(or two storey Villas) cleverly located in amongst the tropical gardens. The central Hotel building resembles a Maharaja's palace with a spectacular atrium, where a magnificent Buffet was served to our party on the first night of our stay. Indeed all the food served at each meal was outstanding. The hotel staff managed the wedding day in an excellent fashion. Our only small issue would be that upon checking out bills for most of our party had been prepared using standard charges, rather than the pre arranged discounted rates for our large party.
After some discussion the Manager agreed to rectify his error.",1
40,"I had visited the restaurant for lunch today with my family. The sea facing view is excellent. Worth going once to experience this.

The ambience and the service was very good.

The F&B manager was very co-operative.
Thank you for for nice hospitaiblity",1
41,Have been at this hotel before. Layout and service is just great. I love this hotel will definitely go again. Prime minister of India and President of Russia stayed the same week. Don't have to say much.,1
42,"Loved the humongous property and its ""family like"" staff. Food and drinks were a bit expensive but you will know where that extra money went when you taste it. Location couldn't be any better. We stayed in the Garden villa room, the view was great, mattress and pillows were comfortable but bathroom was not up to the mark. Check-in and check-out were smooth. Smiling staff and great pool. They deliver fresh fruit basket and news paper everyday in room. We were allowed late check-out as our flight was later in evening. They came to see us off when we were leaving which is a nice gesture.
Totally recommended. 
Special thanks to Kunal on the reception for making our stay memorable.",1
43,"1. In the main building in the hallway between the hull, where restaurants and housing where rooms, there is a door for personnel. Due to this door without ceasing all day you can hear the hum and buzz of aggregates of ventilation and conditioning systems, noise levels exceeded all permissible noise levels to world standards, that's not in my nature to such level hotels as your hotel. My husband noise control specialist and was extremely outraged by such needs. There are effective methods to reduce noise. All systems engineering equipment of the hotel are extremely poor and rundown condition and require immediate diagnosis and repair. 2. The number of deck chairs and umbrellas on the beach at the sea does not match and very little for such a number of people who live in the hotel. 3. Why is the golf courses do not play people in golf. Very much so upset. Itself does not play, but so nice to look at bums stupidly chance dispense balls. 4. very few dishes from fish that swims in the sea nearby, as the menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is particularly true for breakfast. 5. threesome Lived in room, but every day brought fruit, calculated on double room: 2 banana, Apple and pear. I understand that this is a compliment. But you should understand that we have because of the bananas or fight or quarrel. neuzheli when triple stays cannot be put for example-three banana. 6. What's that have to do with ponds, which are located in a residential area. This is especially true of the reservoir in the right part of the site if you look at the sea. Stay close to him. Worth creepy smell and how people live there in private. 7. Understand that available on site shops, have no direct connection to the hotel, but most Please note jewelry store owners to set reasonable, rigid and adequate prices for their goods. It still shop on site 5-star star hotel rather than a market where we must and we can haggle. 8. Need to breed and the lie, which would oversee the population of mice, rats and snakes, Yes at the same time with the cats would have understood. Twice have had unpleasant encounters at with rats who brazenly not nobody asking nursed through the corridors of the hotel in the evening. 9. Staff in restaurants a lot and especially at breakfast. There were several occasions when the waiter asked on their own initiative, that you bring coffee or tea? and vanished in the -20 15 minutes or forgot about posted order. 10. in General, the hotel liked more than upset. Thank you so much. Had a wonderful 10 days no were marred and only make back to GOA again and again. The observations made to the leadership was what to do during working hours.",1
44,"I had attended an Int'l conference here in 2002. I promised myself to return again sometime again soon since it was a rushed week. Finally I was able to return here after 15 yrs. I noticed many changes since last visit. This property was barrier free then, but not anymore. Must be due to security reasons. I enjoyed my overall stay at this hotel. Wednesday night was buffet night and there were variety of delicious food. If anything to suggest, do not visit during the monsoon season. It being low season they were also repairing their property therefore no sleep until late morning, which was not fun for a person on vacation. I had few bad experiences due to weather and construction related issues which was unfortunate but the Resident Manager, Siddhartha did his best to accommodate and make sure my stay was memorable. Looking forward to visiting Goa's Taj Exotica again during the spring season soon. I just hope that I won't have to wait another 15 years to visit this beautiful property again.",1
45,Travelled here in December was nice to see the staff welcoming especialy Namits.Amazing situ on Benaulim Beach. Plenty of loungers on a great pool . Great service throughout. Loved my staff.Arnab helped me with food options.Ganga at coffee shop was excellent he served us really well.will definetely come back.,1
46,"Fantastically located hotel in front of Galle Face. We stayed in the club rooms, which are spacious and give access to the Executive lounge and benefits. The hotel has a pool and gym, the breakfast buffet is fantastic. At times and in places the Taj is looking tired.. I guess when the new hotels they are building next door are complete they will have to up their game to compete",1
47,I went to celebrate the new yr and it became the best yr of my life by visiting there the staff members were very good in nature as can be seen by there talk and it also pocket freindly so i request to uall also visit and enjoyHope to visit soon as i loved the facilties...,1
48,"Good place for a relaxing stay, with the view and the grass. Golf course OK with good coach (Vijay). Breakfast not enough International. You can diner on the beach in the area (better than in the restaurants inside the hotel). Room comfortable, but you can sometimes hear the neighboor.",1
49,"Located far from the colourful hustle and bustle which is Goa, this property is perfect for a relaxed family getaway. We were a family of 6 adults, there to celebrate my Mom's 75th birthday. Lovely huge rooms and baths. In fact, the luxury rooms and suites are better than the villa rooms with plunge pools. The villas have the old vintage style decor, so the baths have the look and feel of old, outdated fittings. Our preference is for the modern, updated style, so had the folks moved out of the plunge pool villa to an executive suite. Food and service excellent as usual. The extra arrangements of a cake and room decorations were wonderful too. Two thumbs up!",1
50,We stayed for 2 nights with kids at this place. We had a villa with garden view for one night and ocean front the other which are recently built (or renovated) and looks more modern. Beach is about 200 meters away from the property. South Goa beach are usually not crowded. Kids enjoyed pool and children's activities. Staff is good. If you stay for 2 nights or more ground transportation to and from Airport or Train station is free.,1
51,"I have been visiting this hotel for 10 years. The staff have become very greedy, food price has increased by 10 times, There were no beach beds as they were banned by the government which they did not inform the clients. Very Poor show on hotels part",0
52,"Great property, great location. BUT The service is not as great as expected. They don't have their own fleet of cars and drivers, it's all outsourced so it's a luck of the draw if you get anyone decent. Our airport pickup was not very professional. Made us walk for about 10mins on the road weaving in and around moving cars and then left us to wait in the middle of a junction where cars started going around us, like we were a roundabout, quiet an unnerving experience. The car that picked us up was filthy and the driver was not professional!!
When we arrived at the hotel the welcome was not very warm. We had to wait 6 hours for our room. We were not even offered water or refreshments while we waited! 

This hotel also will not organize any tours for their guests, guests are expected to organize everything themselves!! We were just given a map and told to call up and arrange ourselves!!

I also noticed most of the staff on the ground are motivated out of fear! I asked one guy who was cleaning to give me directions within the hotel and he told me he couldn't walk me to the area I wanted to get to because if he was seen with me his bosses would swear at him and insult him. I feel bad paying premium rates to an organization who treat their staff this way. Taj Exotica, This is 2016!!
This is our first experience of Taj hotels, will unlikely stay with them again.
To complete this review with a positive, the food is good, but some of the restaurant staff clearly do not have the training. It's not their fault, it's the management!! 
The breakfast crew were the best !!",0
53,"Stayed in the Taj Exotica for 5 nights between 5th and 10th October 2016. Originally we had booked for 9 nights, but before we even left Scotland, we had a telephone call from the lovely Indira (Sales & Marketing Manager) to explain that the BRICS Summit (world leaders and trade politicians) were taking over the hotel on 12th October, and we would have to be moved to another Taj Hotel. As it turned out, we actually left 2 further days early, because the BRICS Summit was so invasive, so noisy, so disruptive and so inconvenient. I have to emphasise that Taj Hotels had no control over this - in fact, we felt really sorry for the hotel staff who were being controlled just as much as us. Restaurants were being closed; bars were being emptied; furniture moved; security was becoming intense; and our peace and privacy was being taken over by construction workers, media people and officials. Basically, the hotel was being taken over by the Indian Government under very strict security, and we had no recourse. I cannot thank Taj Hotels enough, for their tolerance, their understanding and their service, during this very challenging period.
The hotel is very beautiful - a little old in places, but our rooms were really lovely, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The 5 days and nights we had at the Exotica were good. We were moved to the Vivanta by Taj Fort Aguada in North Goa, where we were given amazing upgrades by way of compensation. The hotel staff, and Indira D'Lima in particular, could not have been more helpful. However, the hotel was being renovated around us, for the BRICS summit - everything was being painted, mended, cleaned and smartened up. My friend went to the Spa for a pedicure and her feet were coated in silver paint from the foot basin - not a good experience.
All in all, I am sure this is normally a lovely hotel, but we saw it in very difficult circumstances for tourists, and although Taj Hotels did their very best for us and we totally appreciated that, the Indian Government should be ashamed that they treated their tourists so badly, to make way for world politicians. I would normally rate this hotel good or excellent, but on this occasion, it has to be poor.",0
54,"Rooms are old and need to be refurbished, cleanliness of room really average. During my stay, constant motor noise of grass cutter or high pressure water jet. food of the Indian restaurant is average (only the Chinese restaurant Li Bai is good), staff is friendly but not really skilled. Price is too high for the offered services.",0
55,"There are better places I believe to choose.
This is not the Taj which we used to experience . I am thoroughly disappointed with the the way they manage the guests.
First of all they don't care for room preference when I asked for a room close to beach they gave me the farthest what's the point paying such steep price.
Although the servicing folks and are nice . Front desk persons lack experience. Don't care for any choice of the customer.
My colleague had a horrible experience they complained that he spilled ink on the bedsheets which is cheap allegation , they even asked him to pay money . I think pretty soon they will ask you to pay for so
Spilling water in the bather and sand in the room. This is not Taj !!",0
56,"My wife & I visited here in April 2016 for our anniversary meal at the Miguel Arcanjo restaurant. We had booked in advance and informed them this was a special anniversary treat for us and we had travelled a long way to get there. They had kindly accepted an Amazon package the day before for us, which contained a present for my wife in it.

As we arrived, I asked the Maitre D' if I could please have quick access to the hotel wi-fi connection for 1 hour as I needed to check an email.

He returned and said that it was not possible for a non-hotel guest to access their wi-fi network.

I asked again nicely and he said he would get the IT guy to try.

The IT guy then comes to our table and says that is is impossible for us to get access to the internet.

I ask him to please check with his boss and see if we can please quickly go online.

Some time later, he returns and says that we can access the wi-fi network,but it will be 900 Rupees for 1 hour.

I then ask the Maitre D' to please check this, as this seems a lot of money for 1 hour of wi-fi access. 

He returns and says it will be 900 Rupees. I ask him to check again as I don't think that is reasonable and we will leave if that is the case.

He checks with his manager and returns and says that remains the case.

My wife and I leave the restaurant and go home. Why?

1. We were about to spend 12,000 Rupees on a lunch. To charge 900 Rupees extra for the internet is ridiculous.

2. At 900 Rupees per hour, it would have been cheaper to get a room and become a resident, as 22 hours of the internet would have been 20,000 Rupees which is less than a room there.

3. We had just left Johncy's bar in Benaulim 2 km away, having bought 1 Kingfisher beer for 80 Rupees and had free wi-fi there.

Petty. Small-Minded. Poor customer service. Wi-Fi costs the hotel nothing to share with a guest like us. Good luck to them.",0
57,"Spent the long weekend with the wife and kids this month. 3 nights 4 days. 

First the good bits. Sprawling beach front hotel over 56 acres with well manicured lawns and spacious rooms. Great people serving guests in most parts of the hotel (see not so nice bits for terrible staff). Child friendly with a number of activities engaging kids through the day. Clean beach and beach beds offered on the beach by the hotel. 

The not so great bit. Had a nasty experience at their restaurant near the beach. The lobster shack has a manager with a foul mouth and nasty temper who threatens and says stranger things unprovoked. The restaurant ran out of potatoes (yes this is not a typo - POTATOES) which were on the menu. The manager of the restaurant walked up to us telling us that we are in ""a sea food restaurant and we shouldn't be expecting vegetarian food"" On pointing out to him that its on the menu he said ""i'm talking to you nicely ....."". Restaurants run out of food sometimes (even 5/7 star hotels such as these)- no problem with that - the attitude however is unworthy of the hotel rating and the price they charge, the rudeness is totally unacceptable ever from a road side shack. I am not sure I am doing justice in explaining the nastiness of the experience but I can tell you this that im not one to get impacted by undertones. 

Request to meet the General manager was turned down and director F&B met with us apologizing for his colleagues behavior. Usually Taj hotels have very high standards of service - having stayed in a number of taj hotels across cities.",0
58,"It was not as great as we thought it was going to be, especially the dining. Service was very slow and each course didn't arrive at the same time especially main courses. The side dishes took at least an additional 10/15 minutes after the meat/fish arrived so the meal was not hot or warm. We ate in the same restaurant as breakfast is served. Very disappointing.",0
59,"Pre-stay emails were handled curtly and professionally. At first, a rate sheet was sent and I was later urged to book an expensive room. Taking hints and advice from fellow reviewer's, I did not sway and stuck to the Garden Villa. We went for the Monsoon Package with all meals and airport transfers. I am a Taj Gold Inner Circle Member so I had expected a few extra's. That happened in the form of moving rooms thrice in 2 days. From the Iron Griddle to the Frying Pan and then straight into the fire! Let me summarize my review into the Good and the Bad.
Yes, I would be very critical in rating this property when it markets itself as being a 5 Star resort and charges customers so heavily, being arguably the best property in Goa?!
After the dilemma on what rating would be apt, I settled for Poor. Read on!

The Good:

- Professional handling at the airport. We were escorted to a private car for transfers to the Hotel. 45 mins and we were there
- Beautiful property spread over 50 acres of greenery
- Hats off to the staff that maintain it. Surely difficult to maintain this vast expanse!
- Service extra-ordinaire from everyone around. Selfless and very courteous. That itself would win a 5 star rating. 
- Good public swimming pool and a relaxing stretch of private beach. All very nice. We were in Heaven!
- Plenty activities indoors. We tried Archery. There is Pool, Tennis, Cricket, Gold and others.
- Evening entertainment programs were good
- Live Goan music. A nice touch in the room with balloons, a customized pillow and birthday decorations since we were there to celebrate the birthday of my wife.

The Bad:

- Shoddy cars for airport transfers. Very old, poorly maintained. Dangerous drivers both ways who used the ""brake"" very freely and only wore seatbelts until we were in city limits. Amazing!
- Far and secluded in South Goa. Nothing outside and a taxi ride to the nearest habitation would cost at least 300-400 Rs single way. Basically you are at the mercy of onboard food. More about it later!
- No recognition given for my Gold status. You guys should take lessons from the Hilton, IHG and Marriott Groups in regards to Status Recognition offered to higher tier status members at Check In and throughout the stay!
- As already said, we moved 3 rooms. First day was a Luxury Room- I would have expected that upgrade anyways since I was a Gold member, but they demanded an upgrade voucher, so I gave that to them.
- Anyway- the Luxury room- Dimly lit, old tacky furniture, not child friendly- sharp fruit knives on Table, old and dilapidated. A century old washroom in tatters. The selling point was the Jacuzzi in the washroom, which we tried to use at 10 pm. Old mucky and smelly water splurged out. Housekeeping was busy till 11.30pm trying to clear off the drainage by refilling and emptying the tub. The doors to the verandah could not be locked leaving the room open and hence a chance towards breach of security. Of course that was fixed too. The bed was soft n soggy. Very poorly placed electrical outlets. Overall non-ergonomically viable. 
- Next room change was to the ""Sunset Villa"" with a private plunge pool. Okay, this was given to us as a favour of a ""real"" upgrade- from 3pm on Day 2 to 12pm sharp on the next day of check-out. We were told that they would join two twin beds- that's the best they could do. Apparently this hotel of 140 guest rooms is always sold out, even on a Monday!
- Anyway- The ""Sunset Villa""- old and dilapidated- again everything in tatters. The so called plunge pool had sticky floors, wonder when it was cleaned the last time. Just the feel of that made me feel yucky and dirty! So the ""Upgrade"" went to waste. The holder for the showerhead in the washroom was so loose that the telephone shower dislodged itself from the holder when the shower would be turned off and would hit straight on the head. I hurt myself badly due to this, but learnt the way the second time around. I had already spent enough time with maintenance teams in my previous room, so I did not bother to go through it all over again. This Villa was a big disappointment.
- So we wanted a late check out and we had to exit the Sunset Villa. The front office staff did us a huge favour of giving us yet another room and forgetting that I was entitled to a late check out as a Gold member. Anyway, we went though the troubles of a room change again at 12 noon on check out day and this time it was the worst room of the lot!
- Yes, a small dingy twin bedded room with a horrible shower. The room was tucked in a corner with a view of a concrete wall outside the window. I had requested the guys to place me into the Jacuzzi Room they had given us the first day but obviously that wasn't honored. So enough about the age old tacky and dimly-lit rooms.
- Moving onto food- another great disappointment, with only a few sparks of brilliance.
- The Lunch meal at Miguel Arcanjo left us hungry at the end. And angry too! Such small portions of beautifully decorated average tasting food. Common guys, buckle up! Need I say more? 4 Course set menu's in lieu of the buffet option at the Coffee Shop. These guys tend to forget how much has been already paid as part of the meal package!
- Rest of our meals were at Eugenia, the 24 hr Coffee Shop. Yes, we didn't dare to try Alegria (Goan Food) or Li Bou (Chinese) after the horrific experience of tiny morsels of food at Miguel Arcanjo. We didn't wanna end up hungry with a 2 year old child as there is nothing to offer outside the Hotel premises and food indoors is heavily expensive if not on the ""all-meal"" plan.
- At Eugenia- Dessert's were always impressive, sparks of brilliance at the Live Counters. But the regular buffet was very average. Again this left us high and dry. Traveling to Goa, locked in a Resort with nothing outside, at the mercy of food indoors, all meals paid for and yet no sea food, no Goan fare, no feel of Goa. Common guys, at least see how much you are charging and what you are offering in return! Absolute loot and not justified!

In Conclusion- The rating dropped down from a 5 to a 2 (Poor) only because of the poor quality of Rooms and Poor food with NO GOAN feel whatsoever. We do not buy the excuse of planned renovations and planned up-lift. Sorry, but you do not charge us any lesser for your planned renovations!
We paid through our nose to get treated through a shuffle of 3 rooms, each worse than the other and the worst part was that the reception made us feel that we were in for a huge favour! Nope, the customer notices every nuance of how things are being dealt with and we are not prepared to pay huge amounts for a shoddy stay! The Gold status for Taj Inner Circle is the biggest waste as there is no recognition whatsoever and we would not like to be treated as any other customer if we are loyal to the Taj Group to make it up to Gold!
There is lots and lots of scope for improvement. I hope the Management does not write back an empty apology with promises of upcoming renovations or this stay being an aberration to the usual high standards!
And no, we will probably not visit again!",0
60,"The first and foremost priority in a hotel is good service. This is primary for any hotel. I really feel you were not up to the mark in this. In my stay I had to continously face one or the other service issues due to which I just did not bother to notify the staff anymore, rather feel to put it on trip advisor or expedia where me and my friends book the trips and I am sorry I would think twice recommending your hotel. I was so impressed with Taj Vivanta Hari Mahal that I chose to stay in Taj Exotica but I had to experience the following issues Day 1 Bad quality of food provided in the room. When reported to the chef and manager I was sent some desserts that also without any cutlery when I again phoned to ask for cutlery I was provided with table spoons instead of tea/ dessert spoons. I did report and I was assured by the Chef, Assistant Manager In dining and the very next day the resident manager that I would not face these issues. Day 2 The breakfast fruits and cookies where not in my room where as the other room 115 had them both the rooms had no cutlery again. Day 3 I ordered some snacks from in dining on that evening in that the sauce was missing. I called up the indining to check and I was sent the sauce and the boy who delivered said sorry that he forgot. Day - Checkout It is a nice gesture of you guys that you provided the kids with complimentary pillows with their names on but on the day of checkout we left the pillows on the bags so that kids could take them, somehow they were missing again. A service issue which we faced. I think your housekeeping staff will be well aware of what things need taking and what stays back??? I really feel that paying service and luxury tax on my stay was worthless and waste of my money. Also would be rethinking of my next holiday stay in Taj properties. As an expatriate who lived abroad for many years we go on brands which have built over years it really makes me wonder now if you guys take the brand value as seriously as we do in west. The only positive thing I have to say about you guys is about the security team where they went over my expectation and got back the walking stick of my father who left it in one of the hotels. We really appreciate this and thankful for it. Hope you improve upon your service.",0
61,"Needs complete re-modelling, SPA is inadequately sized with tub sized hot and cold pools. Swimming pool is very small. Hotel gives a very run down feeling. Although the staff is nice and polite. Buffet layout is very restricted.",0
62,"Flies on the extensive buffet spreads, plastic bottles, milk packets , shoes and all other kinds of rubbish you could imagine on the beach( made you want to sanitizer your feet after taking a walk there) - standard reply from the management- ""it's the monsoons. Nothing we can do about it""
- welcome to the great monsoon experience at the Taj!!",0
63,"My wife and I went there for a short break in May, 2015. We had reserved online and called ahead to ensure that we got a first floor Luxury Room. We didn't. The had kept a ground floor room for us which we did not want. So with a promise that they would give us what we wanted we settled for a lower category first floor room for one night.

This room had a blocked/slow running basin outlet and a shower diverter that kept popping out several times during a bath. We were glad to leave the room after the first night.

Next day we moved to a luxury room on the first floor - out of the frying pan into the fire!. We spent two very uncomfortable nights. The main problem was the entrance to the bathroom. You had to go through a very narrow passage passed the shower enclosure to reach the wash basin and other conveniences. This meant stepping on the bath mat if one had been spread. And the shower! There was a small wire rack to keep your shampoo, etc. which was damaged and not replaced. So the shampoo and conditioner kept falling off. Worse, the slope of the shower floor was towards the door. This led to water accumulating every time one of us showered and water would also seep out onto the bath mat. Also shampoos that fell down would be floating in the dirty water and so had to be washed out or discarded. So we got a stack of bath mats which we had to change every time we used the shower. And to wash our as yet dirty feet we had to use the jacuzzi at the other end of the bathroom. 

The attached balcony was nice though the mosquito control had not been up to the mark. We were covered with bites after our two evenings sitting there - smoking is only allowed in the balconies and not in the rooms.

The rest of the hotel is of Taj standard though what we ordered at the restaurant (Eugenia) was not that well made. The pool is also just barely passable.

We may go back after the property is renovated but not till then.",0
64,Very old hotel. After renewing it will be much better. And they start it already. Not enough privacy on villas. very poor and not tasty breakfast. And for 5 star it should be much better. But the price like 5 star hotel its cheating. I will not recommend this place.,0
65,"Goa is gorgeous. The beaches are incredible, the shacks with delicious food and drink are lovely, and I really thought the Taj would complement this experience. Sadly, no. Day 1, we were woken up at 5 a.m. by trucks at some refilling station. 
Day 2, we were told that the hotel was fully booked, and we couldn't move rooms right then, yet, there were guys taking radiators/air conditioners out of the room right next door. But then we were later moved further up the hill.
Day 3, there was a pube in my teapot.
Day 4 we were charged for water at the other restaurant we were relegated to because the main resto was too busy for breakfast.
Day 5 there was an intense natural gas smell in the bathroom of our new room. The manager didn't understand what this could possibly be, and said he'd check it out. But people didn't come.
Day 6, FINALLY LEAVING DAY, there was a big ole roach in our room. At this point I was just sort of numb from it all, so I didn't even really freak out.

Overall, everything was kind of dirty and dingy. Staff was so-so on pleasantness. I kinda get that after witnessing the way they were treated by young wealthy Scandinavians and Russians. But jeez, what is this place?!?!?

Management tried to make amends with some fruit and some Indian wine (dear heavens...Indian wine...)
I wouldn't go back. I would spend more money at a great shack on the beach, the one next to Calamari.

India is fantastic, I can't wait to go back and stay somewhere more local.",0
66,"I have reflected on whether or not to write this review for some tine. And i feel I have a responsibility to share my experience.

Basically being sick there from their good cost me several thousand and after a week thinking about it i realize they should pay me!

I requested struct ayurveda cuisine weeks before and was told no problem.its not complicated and basically healthy ...

I was sick and on bed the entire duration from the food. 5 fays

The service was non existent until they knew I was sick. For example

Arrival - given sugar drink i expressed allergies to 

No awareness of my dietary needs

Waited 3 hours after checkin for pot hot water and lemon

Was told they have a strong program fpr yoga when i booked and after there learned 45 minutes a fay only which is not even enough time for a reap class

I was interrupted for room cleaning continuously when I expressed I was sick and not having

Many staff do not speak enhlish -but they say yes so you wait for hours to learn nothing being good


After the hotel doctor visit everyone was kinder and more helpful

I wrote a note to management about my illness and never had a response- no response whatsoever 

The only good thing here is the bed linens

Unless you like to waist money- stay away 

Go to a Marriott or 4 Seasons trust me",0
67,"Amazing property but rooms are outmoded. Good place for family holiday especially for kids, riding cycle in such a scenic greenery was a wonderful experience.The beach is just 5 mins away from the hotel.Staffs were excellent and very courteous.Food was also good. Greenery is just mindblowing and eye-catching,well maintained. Only thing is pool villas are quite outmoded where we stayed and even wifi was not working properly.",0
68,"e were to stay at Taj Exotica on the weekend of May 6-8 for celebrating our daughter's bday.
The hotel not only cancelled our reservation without checking but also never informed us about the cancellation. No call, no email, NOTHING!!
We learnt about the hotel cancellation when we called the hotel for arranging the airport pick up. We talked to three different representatives; including Floor Manager at the customer care center (Mehak) who never called back despite the promise of the same. At last we talked to Sonia from the Taj Exotica Goa, who came back with the offer of a downgrade in the room. Thanks but no thanks TAJ. We booked a room at Park Hyatt instead but the whole experience was disappointing to say the least. We chose Taj over Park Hyatt initially solely on their golden service standards, this experience was a huge let down. I am glad we made that call to confirm the airport transfer else we would have reached the hotel unaware of this goof up and ruined our happy occasion.",0
69,"Rakesh Sarna needs to get this hotel in shape staff are great, the managers are on the fiddle big time. Have ruined my daughters first trip to india. The managers are over charging and changing invoices. So you think you have a set price booked from uk, but then the managers change it and add extras. My daughters experience was ruined, 5 hours fighting with managers they missed there trip that was paid for. On top of that they were given another bill for s day with extortionate prices.. Rakesh Sharna its your move.",0
70,"Bad, bad, bad Taj ........ this is now you!

I had a meeting in Goa near the airport yesterday and it was over by 12.30 and my flight was at 5pm so I decided to have a treat and go to Taj Exotica (have not been here for over 10 years) and have a nice relaxing lunch.......

Drove the 40 minutes from airport and arrived only to be told by security that all restaurants are closed today ........ Hotel ..... All restaurants closed? Not possible ..... something must be open ....... No all closed!

Why asks I ...... Reply just closed and non residents can not come in!

Ok Supervisor plse ..... and name of GM plse ...... they refused to name the GM but supervisor came and repeated all restaurants closed ...... Pushed the issue and he said private party on so no outsiders ........

I choose to go to another property ....... my choice was not good but at least I got lunch.

This is not acceptable for a 5 Star property at all ........

Bad bad bad Taj",0

At the last moment the hotel Staff now tells us that we cant click any photos and denying that they said it; All our plans have to be now changed;

72,"Six of us were in the Taj exotica lobby lift. We were there with group of friends to attend a function on 17th October 2015. It was around noon. The lift started and abruptly halted in between the floor. Every one in the lift panicked. We pressed the emergency buzzer as well as called through lift intercom.

For good 15 minutes no one turned up where as the lift is right at the corner of the main lobby.

Even when they came, they could not open the door and hence started to manually pulling up the lift.

The resident manager who would have come by now assured us that lift is blocked , it will not move up. He gave us stool to help climb us up as the stool is lowered to the lift floor.

We were very apprehensive of this as we have been observing Taj staff's inability to control the lift. Amongst us we discussed the situation as we know lifts are known to start in between and person getting crushed leading to fatality. We were very afraid as nothing was happening.

Out of 5 two were women and they started panicking more and also feeling nauseous. 

Resident manager assured us to come out using the lift as it won't move. Seeing no other option, as the 5 of them climbed up and moved out of the lift, the lift began to move down. That was what we feared and resident manager assured us sighting everything is under control. Clearly they were not up to the task and were unprepared.

I am sure, had I also climbed ,I would have crushed between lift door and on rushing floor.

the lift started sinking with me inside,everyone panicked again .

As the half ajar lift doors started approaching basement ,I jumped down to the floor beneath not knowing whether doors will open or not as lift touches ground floor.

My wife was in a complete state of shock fearing worst happening at the basement so as my other friends.
However our ordeal was far from over.

When we asked about lift details , it's maintainance, safety measures , the resident manager stone walled us.

He even refused to provide a compliant form saying Taj hotel doesn't have this process.

Here we are coming from a near fatal miss situation and now facing very unlike Taj official ,refusing to even register it leave aside offering an unconditional apology..

We were very tired after the cricket event and more so after the lift incident, so decided to leave.

The entire episode left a bad taste .

We will surely take this matter to logical conclusion.",0
73,"We are a big fan of Taj exotica and have been here in 2011. On my current trip to Taj exotica, we found that the service has gone down considerably. We got two side by side villas with a garden right outside. One of the rooms locks was broken so it took them an hour to fix. As soon as we entered the other bathroom, we realized that the flush was not not stopping. It took them 2 hours to fix all that...soon after we realized that the bulb in the same bathroom was flickering and there was a small cockroach as well in the bathroom. Since this is a garden villa, we were ready to forget all of this and move on. Next day, we noticed that even though this is a garden style villa there were no garden chairs. So we asked them politely. The room service said since this is monsoon season they have taken them away. We reminded them that there are chairs in other villas...well sir thats only for pool villas!!! Hmmm....we are not really paying that much different, are. They politely refused and it really put a bad taste in my mind. I am here for a week and have booked two villas. There is a garden in front of my villa and i want two chairs!!! thats its. And they did not want to budge. Does not seem like the same hotel we visited four years ago. A little disappointing...",0
74,"1. I made this booking over the phone & quickly received a confirmation code on my email - 87243142. I was told that I will soon receive the bank details so I can deposit the amount. This booking was made on 11th June, 2015 at 6.15 PM.
2. I waited till 12.30 PM of 12th June, 2015 but did not received the bank details. Then I sent an email to the reservations team but there was no reply. Then I called up the property & spoke to Ninotschka. She quickly sent the bank details to me at 4.47 PM on 12th June, 2015. Till then the bank was closed.
3. I was further told that the booking will be held till 12th June. HOW CAN I PAY IF I DO NOT KNOW THE BANK DETAILS???
4. It takes 24hrs for the beneficiary to be added. Moreover I do not use a Credit CARD which I feel no one needs to force me for this.
5. I visited the BANK at 10.30 AM today i:e 13th June, 2015, stood there for an hour & got to know that cash cannot be deposited because its a UBS account. Now how on earth do I know what is an UBS account? I am told I need to visit the HEAD BRANCH of HDFC, Pune. This is not possible as the bank closes at 12.30 PM.
6. The best thing was the people whom I wanted to speak are being guarded heavily & you just cannot reach them at all. There are these morons who keep saying they all are in a meeting!!! This is the sad story in INDIA that people just keep attending meetings & have no time to speak to the customers.
7. Please guys its your duty to let us know that you have a super secret bank account which does not accept cash from any branches of HDFC other than the head branch. The person on the phone quickly said that I cannot speak to the GM Mr. Saleem Yousef-- which I do not why??? and then its not their fault about the bank account...its the fault of HDFC....INDIA is just amazing....ZERO marks to the daft people working for TAJ Group !!!!!!",0
75,"If you book and pay in advance then watch out. I made a booking and then requested to move it out by two months. This was due to my wife's Visa being held up in the Indian High Commission (despite having no problems with 3 previous Visa's).

They insisted that moving my booking was the same as cancelling. I made it clear that I would pay any differential amount and understood that I might not get a similar room to the one booked initially.

Totally unsympathetic. They just took my original money, for three nights stay and told me nothing could be done. If you want to deal with people like that then go ahead and book a holiday with Taj hotels , at your peril. I of course will not have anything to do with this nasty little hotel chain.",0
76,This was our last stop on our tour of India. Lovely welcome from the Manager who chatted to us on arrival. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our room was very large with a fabulous bathroom. The views were just amazing over the lagoon. Lovely breakfast buffet with plenty of choice. Beautiful private beach with attentive staff. Thoroughly recommend.,1
77,"Very few places, even amongst the most luxurious of hotels and resorts, make you feel at home. That luxurious yet cozy, relaxed and warm feeling. Courteous staff, delicious F&B, well-decked up rooms, amazing property. It has been a couple of years, but I know I'll come back here again and again.",1
78,"We actually visited here in April 2014 but wouldn't let me select that far back. Absolutely beautiful resort. Rooms were huge and gorgeous with the ponds right out the windows. All inclusive we had too, Ahh sooo much lovely food. Ahh the food and the puddings. And the bed!! Oh the bed was amazing. And the beach, lush too, and the rooms, did I mention the rooms? And the size of the bath, and the room service and buggy's to drive you around. :)) where do I stop!! Fantastic and probably one of our most favourite stays ever!!",1
79,"I booked this hotel on the recommendation of friends and our travel agent and we have not been disappointed!

The lagoon terrace room has everything we need, no point to upgrade, our Room 265 is relatively nearby to the hotel, the setting is overlooking a stunning lagoon, but keep the patio doors firmly closed and take lots of mosquito repellent as they definitely bite!

As far as comfort goes, the bed is extremely comfy, with lovely linen and a pillow menu on request. There is good air con and a large fan over the bed which does a good job. There is also plenty of wardrobe space which is important for a stay of more than a week and which is not a given in every hotel.

At night, there is muted blue light around the buttons which is actually soothing, and the thick curtains allow you to have a good sleep.

The bathroom is perfectly adequate with a great shower, a nice small mirror for makeup as well as large wall mirror.

Bottled water in abundance each day in the room, and the wi fi which is free if you join Discovery club, is perfectly adequate for emails etc.

There is also a nice dressing table area, the only thing that could improve is the hair drier which is not very good! But there is also a full length mirror in the room too. 

The pool is lovely but you need to reserve beds before breakfast. The food at breakfast is great, and the service everywhere in the hotel is excellent.

We attended a Republic Day Buffet around the pool one evening, where the food was fantastic and good value too. We also ate at the Beach BBQ evening which was also a fab evening.

We had a beautiful meal with some friends at the Riverside restaurant which is Italian. on the river. They arranged a romantic table for us actually on the river bank, for my birthday, and it was a very special night.

I cannot rate the hotel enough, suffice to say that we would love to come back again soon. If you want to relax with beautiful views and surroundings, a stunning beach, good service, and comfort, then this is the place for you! 

Leela, you are certainly 5 stars in my book!",1
80,"The Leela, Goa is a grand experience. Lovely landscapes, breathtaking views and excellent hospitality makes it a must visit place. The pristine beaches, lush green gardens, excellent staff and mouth watering food make it all together unforgettable experience.",1
81,"Typing this eating my final breakfast at this wonderful resort. The rooms, facilities and staff are excellent. The food is wonderful as are the grounds I cannot praise this hotel enough. A special thanks to the concierge team including indira, ovina and himansu who were fabulous. And also to Ryan our waiter who looked after us at breakfast. My only complaint is I did not book to stay longer. I'm sure we will be back very soon ",1
82,Its a must visit hotel if one happens to be in South Goa.The property is beautifully maintained with excellent staff service and care for all your needs.Everything from our stay to food to departure was perfect.There play area for kids z quite engaging.They treat there guests very nicely.Overall a gud experience.Also i had requested for a room as per our interest. They took gud care of it and provided us room as per our view. The property has so many activities that one do not need to step out of the hotel.Keep it up guys....Will visit u soon...Now its our permanent stay whenever we visit goa next.,1
83,If you are looking for the ultimate hotel this is it. From the moment you arrive you feel you have been transported to a different dimension. No waiting to check in you are made comfortable brought coconut drink and they bring everything to you. Great start. Rooms comfortable great view from every room. So peaceful. Good food. Food is pricey but you would expect this. Good restaurants 2 minutes walk away. Great jeweller on site. Beaches fantastic. Everything spotless clean. We loved it and will be back,1
84,"Well, we spent 8 nights in ""Leela"" on a half board basis, in a Lagoon terrace room.
The room was amazing, the surrounds are the most beautiful I have ever seen in a hotel.
Maintenance-perfect. Food-perfect. Staff-perfect. Beach-perfect, peaceful, clean, wide and welcoming.
One night we were offered to participate in a BBQ instead the regular Buffet at the main dining room. Well, the food was nice but the entertainment program was quite poor and not appropriate to such a resort. I would not mind having a folklore show to accompany dinner (like in many other resorts, all around the world. In this way one can learn about the culture and the culinary environment all together).
The gardens are kind of a zoological garden, Heaven for birds from so many kinds. You can spend hours trying to spot a Kingfisher doing his thing and the sky is full with different kinds of kites (a bird of prey).
Another thing you might do is- do nothing, which will make you real thirsty, but drinks are never too far away, although they are a little bit pricey (but it is not something you might not expect from this kind of resort). Anyway, beach walks are always a good solution to hang out, meet some locals, collect sea shells and as recommended, simply do nothing and relax.
The ""Leela""-most recommended resort. Don't miss if you are in Goa for relaxation and style.",1
85,"We checked in on our anniversary and as soon as we got back after food, what we see is a complimentary bottle of wine and a small tasty cake. To be thoughtful and arrange such warm stuff within hours of our check in was a pleasant surprise. The gardens and golf course is beautiful with small lotus filled ponds. Every cuisine we ordered was great, especially the nicely done sea food. Strolls by the beach were a revelation too. They also offer some great movies to set the mood, just in case one wants to enjoy in the room itself. Off season and early bookings can get good deals as well. Overall a really wonderful experience",1
86,"We came to the Leela after touring India in need of cosseted rest and relaxation and we found that at the Leela in quantities. It was a near perfect location and the staff and management could not have done more to look after us.
The location is near perfect and the rooms are of a very high standard (we had a lagoon terrace room) immaculately clean and true luxury. It is over 32 acres and they have a good buggy system and bicycles for the more energetic.
The weather in January was perfect with daytime 34-36C and constant blue sky.
The only issues were really twofold. Firstly we were full board and the 'multi cuisine' restaurant is fantastic in a great range of food but there was little that was not a curry variation. They have alternative restaurants (Indian,Seafood and Italian) but they are at additional cost and whilst we were there were deserted. Eating at nearby restaurants is probably essential for any long stay and the Beach Shacks are nearby and have great food from across the world.

All the prices in the hotel look reasonable but are now subject to local and central taxes that increase the bill by up to 40% (and the outside restaurants and shacks do not seem to charge the taxes)

It was a great holiday and we will go back !",1
87,"Just returned from our stay at The Leela and have to say it fully deserves the 5 stars. Amazing staff ( who really made the stay memorable), magnificent beach and wonderful food all within tranquil surroundings that immediately make you feel relaxed.

Our one concern was the very loud music coming for the neighbouring hotel for two afternoons which was extremely annoying as it completely ruined the ambiance. We did complain to the hotel but were informed nothing could be done as it was before 10.30 at night .That said we have still stayed with the 5 stars as we had a terrific time! Thank you to you to everyone at The Leela.",1
88,"Visited the Leela Goa after close to 10 years and must say was pleasantly surprised.

The property is so well maintained and looked after that one feels it was but a few years back.

We were staying at the Lagoon Suites which are very spacious, have a nice balcony facing the lagoon and a decent sized living room.

The lagoon area and the surrounding gardens are very well maintained. The spa and swimming pool also excellent. Restaurants and bars have plenty of choice and shall satisfy the most discerning guests.

Must experience Leela at its best at Goa.",1
89,"Hire a bike , tiddle about the hotel ! But the best exotic marigold experience is found , through the golf course, to the beach , turn left , walk till the sand runs out !!!
There you will see more eagles , birds of prey, and any other creature of flight, looking for drying fish freshly caught , than the Attenboroughs could ever imagine !
All life IS there",1

Stayed January 2017, travelled as a couple",1
91,"Visited with family, still here till 15th January. Awesome hospitality and prompt service. 

Welcome was very warm, hot the coach for pickup from airport. Met Indira at the the reception for check in. Very warm welcome and quick check-in. Indira was very warm and gave all detail information of the Hotel activities and inclusions of our trip which we enjoyed to the fullest.

The bar at the pool side is a very relaxing point which gives experience of awesome warmness and they pamper you like your own family. Nityanand at the bar pampered well.

The Restaurant, which offers buffet, has good variety of multi cuisine food. The staff is very prompt, aware and warm for our requirements.

In all the hotel offers a whole in house activities, entertainment and keeps everyone occupied in one thing or another to enjoy. The beach is really clean and nice, just 2 min walking form the hotel.

Only one thing needs to be taken care of, is the Golf facilities and the Gold equipment. They charge Rs. 1500 + taxes to play Golf which is a 12 holes Gold course which is well maintained but lacks Good Golf clubs/ sticks. The Gold sticks are pretty old, rusted and not maintained at all, over that the playing fee is quite high for the Hotel guest itself. This aspect should be taken care for golf lovers, as my daughter is a Golf Champion and loves to play golf but she could not find a good golf set to play with, nor her size was available too.

In all its a thumbs up stay for us",1
92,"Rooms - AWESOME
Service - AWESOME
Spa - JUST AWESOME

I cannot find anything to fault with in this experience. Leela made my visit to Goa worth it!!! I would love to go back. The spa was the highlight - hygienic, friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet spread was designed for all appetites. Evening entertainment was refreshing - loved the classical ones.",1
93,"There is little this hotel doesn't offer. The staff are the best I've seen, they care and pay attention. Polite, friendly and can't do enough for you. This hotel is located in the South of Goa and away from the hustle and bustle. It's a perfect place to relax with good quality food, stunning rooms (we had conservatory rooms overlooking the lagoon - better than the club rooms personally).

We've already booked to go back.",1
94,"Though I stayed here many times couple of years back this time it was an official offsite get together for three days and it was a wonderful experience at one of the premium and Luxury hotels in India. 
The Leela Beach Resort - Goa gives an amazing feeling and experience has been magical. The resort is located on Mobor beach in south Goa, and has its own private beach and a 12 course golf course. The airport is around an hour away from the resort.
Breakfast which is complimentary has many delicacies included from Indian to Continental choices. Pick up and Drop off from the airport in a car is also included in the package. 
The hotel experience from word go....was an ultimate and very professional in providing the quality accommodation. Room had a beautiful balcony which opens just next to a pond. Room was very clean with soft and smooth blankets, bed and pillows along with towels. The bed sheets were changed twice a day as you would expect in a five star hotel. The room had clean and neat bathroom with everything you can imagine in a bathroom. The staff members were very friendly, polite and helpful. 
Free hire of bicycle was there to roam around the resort and landscape of the hotel. 

The beach was clean and the service on the beach was beyond words and pleasant. Food was yummy and delicious with multiple choices during all 3 courses. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay of 3 days here. Good Job Leela Goa...! Keep it up..!!

No recommendationsdefault choice",1
95,"Having just stayed at the Leela Palace in Bangalore, we had an inkling of what was in store for us at this establishment. They have recently been bought by a Malaysian family and we were keen to compare the two properties. This hotel did not disappoint and was all you could hope for. Excellent quality everywhere, staff friendly and attentive (Ovinda and Indira at front of house were exceptionally helpful). The many restaurants were warm and friendly and served a variety of international cuisines. The buffet breakfast catered for everyone's tastes. The swimming pool was immaculately kept and the resort itself is beautiful. Fish swim in the various lily filled lagoons, photo opportunities everywhere. A stroll to the beach where you can utilise beautiful lounges and take advantage of the bar service.....they make a lovely pina colada cocktail! The food choices at the beach are somewhat limited but covers even the most fussy eater. There are water sports available at this beach. If you stay at this hotel you are less bothered by the local beach sales people.......in fact in two full days we weren't bothered at all. My only advice is to NOT stay during the Russian Christmas period, from around 2nd Jan to 7th ish the place is packed with literally hundreds of Russians enjoying their festive season.",1
96,"Amazing property and beach. I loved the personal service by the staff, along with the beautiful grounds and the kilometres of deserted beach. I went here on a solo trip in an effort to unwind and get away from the chaos of Delhi. The quiet tranquility of the lagoon and gardens, as well as the soothing sun and sounds of the sea, combined to provide the perfect cure for my soul. I highly recommend Goa and the Leela Goa.",1
97,"I have just returned from my first visit to the Leela hotel, Goa with my daughter who is 9.
From the moment we arrived we were treated like special friends coming home.
The kindness and warmth of the staff was so special, with no hint of pretentiousness. We arrived in the very early hours of the morning and were greeted as though it was the middle of the day. Check in was swift without being rushed and we even got our beautiful garland of marigolds which were a lovely touch without being over the top.
Our lagoon room was magical. on opening the doors we were presented with a breathtaking view of giant red lily flowers standing tall amongst huge floating lily pads, egrets and many types of birds swooped here and there, and the divine scent of jasmine and vanilla filled the morning air.
Our bed was deliciously comfortable, and there was even a pillow menu to chose from.
Every detail had been thought of, from the toiletries provided, to the bath salts beside the mammoth sized bathtub and fluffy towels and robes. 
Each day the wonderful Francis kept our room spotless, and homely. My daughters Teddys were always sitting happily on her pillow and bottled water was in ample supply continuously.
The pool was stunning with a swim under waterfall and little cave to swim through. Staff were continuously on hand to take drink or food orders and provide towels, without being on top of you or annoying. There was always time for a chat and friendly word, and all the staff seemed genuinely interested in how our stay was going and where we were from.
Breakfast was an absolute treat, every palate catered for in a beautifully laid out buffet that included the most fabulous array of fruit.
The beach was so clean, and went on for miles.The sea was warm and we spent many hours playing in the waves meeting other families doing the same thing. The hotel has a lovely restaurant on the beach or we could eat at our sunbed. Or we could chose one of the beach cafes for a change. Pearls was excellent, wonderful fresh fish daily, and a great buzz.
I managed a couple of treatments in the Ayuverdic Spa, and I have to say, it surpassed all my expectations. For quality of treatments and time taken, the value for money was incredible. My therapist was so kind with a genuine warmth and caring nature, it really added to the whole experience, as I was made to feel totally relaxed and at ease. Not an easy feat in a new environment. I wish I could have had a different treatment every day. The list was huge, and the products totally natural using Indian herbs and plants.
The property is breathtaking, bridges link various areas, all offering stunning views of foliage and the natural beauty of the place. At night time the lighting adds to the magic, as Indian music comes wafting from the lobby lounge bar, where one can sit and relax with a drink before dinner. My daughter loved the 'moat' that ran around the outside of the main building, as it was teaming with Koi and other fish. Everything is done with such taste and respect for nature. The property is totally safe, so I never had to worry about her going for a walk to the room, or disappearing to follow the fish around.
Chocolate milkshakes by the pool was one of her favourite things, and I have to say they were delicious.
There are a variety of restaurants to appeal to every taste. The Italian Riverside was a lovely experience. The Indian food was also spectacular for any lover of the local cuisine. 
The highlight has to be the New Years Eve gala, which was just above and beyond anything expected. Dancers, singers, all sorts of entertainment for young and old, plus delectable food from every corner of the globe. The work that must have gone into it was mind blowing. Thank you to each and every member of staff for making that evening so special. 
So, in conclusion I want to thank everyone at the Leela for showing me how a perfectly run hotel should be. To the GM, Mr Nair, who deserves every accolade that he receives. To Ms Sandy Anil, for being so kind to me when I needed kindness.
For top class quality, value, beauty, relaxation and all that one could wish for from a holiday, I applaud the Leela, Goa.",1
98,"We just loved the Leela. After 2 weeks travelling around large, bustling Indian cities, we just wanted to relax and be pampered. The Leela was just what we needed and we'd have loved an extra couple of days there. There's nothing gimmicky about this place. 
The Leela has so many staff your every need is easily anticipated and met. 
The rooms are lovely and the Service first class. 
The buffet breakfast is first class. 
The gym is really well equipped. 
If I could moan, I wish the pool was bigger and that you could throw a ball in there (it was often empty apart from us and it would have been nice to have a ""bit of excitement"". 
Don't go here for an energetic holiday. 
Do go here for the best place to relax, unwind and recharge your battery.",1
99,"A super family holiday for 7 of us. A fantastic location with the sea close to the property and swam on all 3 days in the sea which is always a bonus. A great gym which we all made use of along with the lovely swimming pool ( a bit cooler than expected in december!)
On the downside-had booked with booking .com and somehow had booked 3 rooms with 1 person occupying it, but the hotel staff ironed out that problem
We had paid for all 3 meals but standard of breakfast buffet was super but lunch and dinner buffet best avoided.poor choice-taste questionable-also suspect chicken and fish in the same dish- chicken goan curry with portions of fish added in !!
the service, housekeeping,property were definitely 5 star with nearby beach shacks to make the visit more interesting!",1
100,"Simply stunning, my family and I walked into this hotel in awe. It really lived up to our expectations and surpassed them as well. We stayed here during christmas and the gala dinner for new years was really good. We had access to a nice private beach as well which made it all the more enjoyable. Top service from the staff and management as well.",1
101,"We attended Leela Goa from Dec 20th to Jan 2nd. What can I say.. a magical place to be with the family at Xmas and New year. Staff were all amazing. Being vegan and vegetarians they really catered for all of us and went out of their way to make our stay the best. We attended the Xmas and New Year gala dinner which can be quite over priced, but it's all about the experience and had to be done. Thumbs up to Leela Goa.",1
102,"This hotel is in a tranquil setting and the staff go to extra lengths to make your stay an amazing one. The rooms are one of the best I have stayed in throughout the world. 
From the moment you arrive you are treated like royalty and this continues throughout your stay.",1
103,"Beautiful mesmerizing .
We were at The Leela Goa for our anniversary.Had great time there.The complements on anniversary by The Leela was great.Thanks to all.All the staff people very good special thanks to Vijay (Asst.Manager F&B)Great place to stay.
Thanks all and Happy new year.

104,"Great hotel, lovely rooms, excellent service, rooms are situated around beautiful lagoons 
and I loved the little Egretts walking around, really cheered me up.

The slight downside was that the beach is polluted with oil or something so I 
personally would not swim in the sea or walk along the shore line. 
You don't see this sitting on the Leela sunbeds but the grounds within the hotel are so lovely it was not a big thing. Great pool, would have preferred it a bit warmer.",1
105,"We booked the Leela Goa after having a wonderfull experience at the Leela Palace in Udaipur 2 years ago. The Leela again did not disappoint. Our room was great and had a little private conservatory that looked onto a pretty lagoon. The Indian restaurant was great and the chef came out and spoke to us and for the next two nights created dishes specially for us. The breakfast spread in the morning was amazing the biggest selection I have seen anywhere. The beach was beautiful and service everywhere was great. A special mention goes out to Surat at the little beach bar, he was fantastic. The Leela is not cheap but well worth it!",1
106,Stayed at the Leela over New Years. Beautiful hotel with lovely rooms. The food and service was immaculate. Catered for our three year old daughter and best of all was the staff. Very polite and willing to go an extra mile. Highly recommended.,1
107,"The Leela has a wonderful peaceful welcoming atmosphere. They make you feel part of a family. The service was outstanding and nothing was too much. We were upgraded and had our own butler. We even had our own disco one night. The pool is one of my favourites all one height and so easy to be in. I think I left a little of my heart at the Leela. Shridhar Nair, General Manager is quite amazing. Despite being full on busy he makes time to stop and talk to you. He made our stay on my birthday truly a wonderful experience. The bar area is a lovely retreat in the evenings and the sunsets are to a memory to treasure. A must if you go to Goa.",1
108,"There is a reason why the Leela Goa is ranked at the top ten of Cond Nast list of best hotels in the East.
From the time you arrive at the airport your greeted with a fresh towel and a bottle of water you know you arrived at the apotheosis of indulgence. The ride is long but when you finally arrive all that fades in a distant memory. You are whisked away to be seated while you are checked in by a friendly host and are dotted around with an air of fine staff that are ever ready to serve you just at a blink of an eye. You are just mesmerized by the beautiful surrounding and ambiance. The lagoon Terrance rooms are well equipped with its recent renovation and state of the art light switches ample space a stunning bathroom so I want to leave ? 
Overlooking the idealistic lagoon in its splendid array of bird life , tropical flowers this is so surreal .
The service is outstanding and the food at breakfast is on par with the best. Generally the service is par excellent and one can't fault The Leela . It is a well run and manager hotel . The spa was a welcome respite and the beach super gorgeous. 
We ate at the fish restaurant I would say a bit casual die dinner and not much of a fish restaurant but fish is what we wanted and we opted for the fresh fish of the day trust me you won't regret ordering that , which ever fish you choose all were very well prepared and very tasty. The breakfast at the restaurant was so good. My only complaint is that the balance of the restaurants can do better. The golf carts in an about should stop for guest that are walking and not just zoom by . The amendments in the bathroom could include combs ,toothbrushes, mouth wash.
I highly recommend the Leela Goa it is place you would want to return to over and over again. Well done to the team keep up the excellent and hard work that goes into making this a great hotel ",1
109,"It was a perfect holiday destination because of you Leela...nice hospitality very delicious food.. humble and very helping staff, ...thanks for ur services and thnx for the help to find out the best visiting place in Goa...:)",1
110,"we have been there for wedding..one of the excellent property in goa..best five star hotel..huge resort with private beach..huge rooms with all modern amenities..staff,,service,food was very nice..amazing stay",1
111,"This was our first stay in Goa, having stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world over the last few years. From the moment of arrival, it is clear that the hotel sets its service standards very high in every part of the hotel. Superb rooms, all overlooking the lagoons, furnished to an excellent standard and impeccably cleaned and maintained.
Best - Service with a smile from every member of staff and it would be hard to single out individuals (although Niti at the pool bar and Shane and Kinley in the Club Restaurant, and Dr Arun (for his true professionalism) were stand out members of the team).
Location is truly beautiful, with aspects to the beach and river providing breathtaking views.
Worst - Noise intrusion from functions at the hotel next door (although I believe this may be seasonal and The Leela is currently working to stop this). In any case, I doubt it will be sufficient to spoil your holiday.
This is a faultless hotel and we would not hesitate to return. Hopefully soon!",1
112,"Could not have picked a better location and Hotel to celebrate my 65th Birthday. Hotel staff gave a very pleasant surprise on the big day!
Excellent location. Superb views from the Room.
Wide choice of food. Good ""watering hole"" that is popular among the locals as well.",1

114,The leela resort goa is a beautiful place and the restaurant and coffee shop are lovely and the awesome lobby and the food which was serviced over there was tasty and also the room over there are awesome and the logon over there near the room and nice facility,1
115,The Leela Goa is a very peaceful and fantastic place to stay. Very beautiful and luxurious place. The staff was very good. Rooms very very large. Great variety of food. I must say this is the best hotel in Goa.,1
116,"Paradise on earth! Very peaceful, fantastic setting, lots of choice for breakfast and basic room very large and luxurious. It was my husbands birthday a couple of days ago and when we came back to the room in the afternoon there was a cake and a bottle of wine with a card from the manager. We have stayed at some top 5 star hotels around the world and this is one of them. We will definitely be back. The staff are lovely and friendly and I am looking forward to feeling thoroughly pampered for another 7 days still to go! I am in heaven!??",1
117,"The Leela review
I hadn't done too much research before booking The Leela and had concerns with a couple of the recent reviews here. Now having spent a week there, I'm so pleased I booked it. I'm not sure where the bad reviewers were staying, but it certainly was not here!

This is THE place to stay if you're looking to recharge your batteries. At the bottom of the sleepy south coast, it's a beautiful setting. All rooms have great view either across the lagoons (full of things to see) or of the golf course. 70 acres of land and great facilities. We spent most of our time at the beach. It's quite something. Lots of choice for food options both in the hotel and outside. For eating outside the resort, I'd recommend the Fishermans Warf. The food is OK, but the service and setting are well worth the short walk.

I found the staff and service to be exceptional. Not only remembering your room, but what you had to eat on previous nights. Going back to the lounge bar and being asked if we wanted our usual drinks, was a nice touch. The staff really care. Sure, not everyone says hello, but the people who do (and care about their work) more than make up for it. They are motivated and seem to enjoy what they do.

In summary, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Leela. It's not cheap, but when you see what you get and the attention to detail, I'm sure you'll agree it is value for money....and a beach you won't forget for a long long time.",1
118,"Best hotel in Goa by a long shot. From the pick up at the airport to the great service, amazing rooms and delicious food, Leela is a great place to get spoiled. It's not someone on a budget, you pay for what you get.",1
119,"We had just spent 8 days doing the Golden Triangle tour so we were really looking forward to chilling out for a week. We knew the hotel would be nice but we just weren't expecting it to be so luxurious! We were picked up at the airport by the transfer bus and given a bottle of water and refreshing towel. There were only two other people on the bus. When you arrive you are welcomed with a garland and guided into the beautiful open plan lobby/bar/reception area. No need to queue at the check-in desk. It comes to you! We were seated and given a coconut water drink (in the coconut!). A lovely girl took all our details and then we hopped on a golf buggy to our room. It was amazing!! Gorgeous white linen, bath robes, slippers and a bathroom to die for. We had a room overlooking the lagoon with lovely seating area. The grounds are beautiful. A real tropical paradise. The beach is lovely with cushioned sun loungers and waiter service. The breakfast is fantastic. Such a choice!! No matter what part of the world you come from there is something for everyone. The staff were all amazing. Couldn't do enough for you. I can't recommend this place highly enough!",1
120,"This is wonderfully luxurious hotel, voted No. 2 in India and No. 9 in the whole of Asia, by Conde Nast Traveller magazine. (The Taj Palace at Udaipur is no. 1 in India, if you are interested). The outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff. From gardeners to Manager they are all equally welcoming and helpful - clearly a culture that has been successfully implemented across all the Leela staff - and it is so very noticeable.

We had a lagoon suite which was spacious, had everything you could want on a holiday, the pool was nicely laid out and is exceptionally large. We like to swim lengths early in the morning but this circular pool has a diameter which is massive. The pool is definitely cooler than the sea, and more refreshing in the heat.

The other outstanding feature if this hotel is the food which is extremely high quality but also generous in portion size and also in diversity as to what is available. Even the poolside snacks are gorgeous such as vietnamese rolls, Club sandwiches, which, for a single order, is usually enough to feed two people.

Recommended suites to stay in are around lagoon 1 , on the same side as ""The Club"". This is definitely the quietest area of the hotel complex. Despite the lagoons, which are beautiful, there are remarkably few mosquitoes, but spraying up at night is still recommended.

New visitors will benefit from President Modi's new road which runs directly from the airport at Dabolim all the way to the Leela Hotel. This is because there was a BRIC conference at the hotel in Oct 2016 which included the president of China, Putin, President of Brazil, India , Sri Lanka etc, and Modi arranged for it to be totally rebuilt with modern things like cat's-eyes and street lighting, which you won't find on many other roads. So the travel from the airport is fast and smooth.

Overall if you staying Goa this hotel is the top of the list. We have been to Taj Exotica and Taj Fort Aguada and this hotel beats them hands down on every aspect. And we will be going back very soon.",1
121,"This hotel is beautiful, everywhere you look you're presented with a fantastic view and just pure luxury. The rooms are spacious with a balcony over looking the gorgeous lagoons all around. Food is fantastic, particularly the fish restaurant on the beach. Cocktails at the beach bar are the best way to watch the sunset - the best pina colada I've ever had! 

A great variety of activities too, a stunning gold course as well as meditation and yoga over on honeymoon island.

All the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, and the private beach is incredibly beautiful and peaceful.",1
122,"Our 2nd visit to the Leela and from the moment we arrived we were made to feel like long lost friends. We had asked in advance for our favourite room and this was given to us and was ready on arrival. The staff are exceptional and some even remembered us from a year ago (and they really did! Even recalling what we had ordered in the past). The food in every area of the hotel, pool bar, all restaurants, breakfast buffet, was excellent. Rooms are beautiful but it is the staff that make this hotel my favourite. I absolutely love this place, it is quite outstanding. Book with confidence.",1
123,"We stayed with our teenage old son at The Leela Goa on recommendation of friends. Beautiful resort indeed with a white non-crowded beach, stunning gardens, and modern well equipped rooms. 
I personally liked the reception area best which has a distinct Asian feel to it, while the rooms around the lake were more Portuguese in style. The gardens are stunning with an amazing variety of birds.
Loved it. We are coming back, but will not take half board anymore as we felt that the lunch/dinner buffet was the same every day, which got a bit boring after a few days.",1
124,Once I went to this hotel on my friend birthday I had a lots of fun there Evan the interiors are extremely good we stayed there for about three hours and the food items are astonishing we enjoyed every movement the they had a transport facility to the airport I loved to be stayed there more highlighted in hotel is pool every one should go there,1
125,"My husband and I visited the Leela at the end of October (late anniversary holiday). Our son had been a couple of years ago with his wife and two young children and they absolutely loved it so it came highly recommended and we were not disappointed. From the moment we were greeted upon arrival at the airport we were made to feel welcome. The hotel is beautiful and the gardens are an absolute delight to walk through. Accommodation, facilities and restaurants are all very good, in fact we could not find fault with anything. The only slight disappointment was that the beach restaurant had not yet been granted a licence to open (so were informed) by the local authorities but other than that there were 3 others to choose from. We also ventured out to the Fishermans Hut which is a short walk outside of the hotel complex which is frequented by lots of locals as well as hotel guests from the Holiday Inn hotel which is near the Leela. Generally 5 star hotels can plateau and in our experience the differentiation is down to the staff, in the case of the Leela the staff are all extremely well versed in how to look after guests and nothing is too much trouble they are polite and courteous at all times, so congratulations to the management. Overall our holiday was relaxed and we enjoyed it immensely. We highly recommend this hotel.
",1
126,We had a great holiday@ the leela goa. Magnificent landscape added so many treasured moments. The lagoon and beautiful water birds flying around were a treat to eyes. Couple of days can be easily spent on the humongous property. Good activities through the day. Beach area is very well maintained.,1
127,"Let me be upfront on my benchmarks - I travel to Goa every year and have stayed at all the Taj properties there and Park Hyatt. The latter along with Taj Exotica are Gold standard to me, while in Goa. So when I review Leela, I have those benchmarks in mind for a property which positions itself as such.
Now - while keeping those parameters in mind, I find Leela to be a good resort but nowhere when compared with Taj Exotica or Park Hyatt.
The service standard is great as is the food - but rooms are not villa style as they are in the benchmark resorts. I get a feel of a business hotel cum resort, while at Leela which is not what I want when on holiday. Otherwise it is an ok option.",1
128,Amazing hotel in absolutely stunning surroundings...perfect holiday!! Staff were friendly helpful and always very polite...ate out most evenings but when we did eat in the hotel it was lovely..this hotel definitely deserves its 5 stars!!,1
129,"I visited here last year in July(with my Wife and Kid) after 2 Nights of stay in Park Hyatt Goa. I would say Both the Resorts are beautiful luxurious properties and the service and hospitality at offer is premium.
A Day before i was about to check-in i got a call from Reservation Desk asking for any special request that i have. It felt really good that the they were already putting that extra effort to try and make our stay comfortable. I requested for a Crib and High Chair for my kid. They confirmed for Crib and Said that they will try to arrange for High Chair.
When i reach at the resort, the Check-in process was quick and smooth and the room got allocated with 5 minutes or so. Was really happy to see that both Crib and High Chair (of premium quality) are already present in my room.

The room as well was beautiful, very fresh and really modern, with all you need to make your stay comfortable. The Bathroom is luxurious and super.
Room sizes are a little small if you compare it to Park Hyatt rooms but good.

The Mobor Beach was a 5 minute comfortable walk from my Room through a nice small golf course that the resort has. It is a serene, clean secluded beach, although not private but well guarded by Hotel Security. If you can walk for long then do try going to Left End of this beach where the River Sal meets the Ocean. It is a beautiful place. 
The Swimming Pool here is again nice and clean with water temperature nicely controlled. Although it is not very big if you compare it with Park Hyatt, which has one of the most beautiful pools you would find in any five star resorts in India.

Now comes the part that i liked the most about this resort: the Food and Restaurants. It has a beautiful and comfortable restaurant which offers a great variety of cuisines in their Buffet Menu (Be it Breakfast or Dinner). The Spread is huge and the taste is really good for what most of the Five Star Resort Offer.
Though, I personally liked the international cuisines more than the Indian ones, but the variety and taste was really good in general. Here i would say Park Hyatt got beaten comprehensively. 
The Checkout process was also smooth and was pleasantly surprised when they arranged complimentary Toyota Camry for Airport Drop which was like an cherry on top of the cake, making our trip to goa end in a pleasant and comfortable way.

To Summarize: 

Pros:
1. Excellent Spread and Taste of Food
2. Great Fresh and Modern Rooms
3. Nice Clean Beach
4. Big and beautiful Property

Cons: (Most of them in comparison to Park Hyatt, but otherwise not really bad):
1. Swimming Pool.
2. Lawns and landscapes joining the resort to beach are prettier in Park Hyatt
3. Rooms even though beautiful are a touch smaller than Park Hyatt.",1
130,"This hotel is lovely, it's perfectly manicured, we stayed in a club room so had our own pool for people in the club area and restaurant.
The only thing let thing that let the hotel down was the staffs obsession with payment, to the extent that we were accosted in the pool several times to pay instantly and settle bills. ",1
131,"A very nice resort on the beach in South Goa. The location is a little far away from the city, but the hotel and innumerable activities available inside make it up. The beach is also very good and clean and not many outside visitors. There are lot of activities for the children in the hotel itself.
Only issues we had were the buggies which take a little time to come and the food quality could also be slightly improved. But the service of the entire staff is outstanding and always ready to help. Golf course is also very good and had a good training session over there.",1
132,"Stayed here for two weeks in february and had a wonderful time. The hotel is spacious and clean and the staff were very attentive and polite.
The only downside is that it's very isolated so if you're looking for varied nightlife and trips out you'll have to get a taxi.
There are a couple of restaurants within walking distance the best being Bettys Place. We ended up eating here nearly every night as it's great fun, wonderful food and a fraction of the price of the Leela.
Overall we thought the Leela was wonderful.. a little piece of paradise.",1
133,"The location of the hotel is very good, the ambience is excellent, it has huge area with lagoons around and approach to the beach is perfect, the pool and the spa is fine , you can enjoy good spread of breakfast during your stay",1
134,"an elite hotel and as a regular i expected a great deal more from the staff
love the beach and the food but no pint eating in a place where guests are not taken care of .
the lobby staff is courteous but rest everywhere they are a shame to the property.",1
135,"A beautiful property spread across a wide area. With a beautiful and clean private beach, with little crowd, there is nothing else you need more here. I was there for an office off-site, and the overall experience was excellent.

The only negative thing about this hotel is that it is far away from most of the happening beaches of Goa and far from the airport too. But the private beach makes up for everything and it's heavenly in night if you are with the right people. The general features of a hotel like recreation facilities, swimming pools, etc are also there but the natural beauty is something to be attracted to.",1
136,"The hotel/resort is spread out on a huge area & it is wonderful. Rooms are spacious, clean, bathroom facilities are modern includes a bathtub. Bed is comfy & you can choose your pillow if you wish from their varied collection. Food is good/OK as far as the buffet is concerned. The Bar/Play area is good. Conference hall/banquet facilities are good. Staffs are OK. Many of them are good but you may face few who are not well trained. So, all put together this place will be a good choice for both- corporate events or family vacation.",1
137,"3 advantages.. one.. the size is huge and next to the beach .. second.. the way it's made with lagoon facing rooms.. third and most important is the lovely leela hospitality... 
One big disadvantage.. the distance.. except for a fisherman's wharf which is walking distance, zeeboob and Martins corner are almost 40 minutes away. Nothing much to do close by. North goa is again more than an hour away.. Recommended for people who want to relax and use the property and not for people who want to party..",1
138,"I along with my husband and 19 month old son stayed at the leela for 3 nights in July(a leisure holiday). We enjoyed the stay, however nothing spectacular. Overall the staff avoided eye contact or any kind of communication. We took a package of half board. The buffet lacked variety and the food was boring. Usually there was a lot chaos during breakfast. It lacked the charm of a 5 star. Room was done twice a day which i really appreciate. We were not offered any cot for my son. Even newsapers were not delivered as promised. The presentation of in room dining was not appealing. Beach was very clean and we enjoyed our walks there. Pool can be enhanced. The kids room didnt have quality toys and was not very clean. The lady in the kids room looked utterly bored. Also the hotel's bar lacks the zing thing..i mean they are boring. Also not much activities to do in the resort. In future i would prefer park hyatt over leela.",1
139,"I was on a company trip recently (Aug 12 - 15, 2016) and would capture the pros and cons below:-
Pros
1) This is a huge property. No wonder there are carts to take people around.
2) Lots of greenery with water bodies around. I think the property is maintained very well.
3) Spacious rooms and overall ambience is also great.
4) Has a nice beach too

Cons
1) A lot was left to be desired in general service at the restaurants. Servers took a lot of time and it seemed they did not understand the request a couple of times. E.g. Asked for a glass of water, after 5 mins again followed up and yet again (after 5 mins). By the time a glass could be arranged I had gulped it from the bottle. Apparently this was not an exception as some of my colleagues reported similar incidents.
2) Wifi was a paid service which I was expecting to be provided complimentary.
3) Food could be better. Specially the indian fare.
4) Few of my colleagues (across separate rooms) faced problem with their room doors which did not recognise the card. Though I trust it must be a one off thing.",1
140,"Fantastically oppulent hotel setin acres of gardens. Has own beach. Rooms are wonderful as are all of the staff. Without exception.
The food is spectacular and suitable for large parties. Ok it is pricey but you get what you pay for. If you can possibly afford it then its a great place to stay as we really rated it highly. We have only given it a four because it was a bit out of the way and my husband is not able to walk far and we had to use taxis. Only reason. Fantastic place.",1
141,"It's a nice experience.. Lovely property with great ambience. We expected some rain during the stay.. But we were lucky. The staff were very good, always there to help. The rooms are spacious... The bathrooms could have been better ..operationally.",1
142,"The hotel ressort is extremely nice, staff is well trained and the service very friendly everywhere! Overall atmosphere is wonderful and food is very good. The ressort is embedded in a beautiful freen garden, full of flowers. Yoga lessons, the SPA and ayurvedic treatsments there are extremely nice. We enjoyed the fantastic beach with only one exception: There was plenty of tar coming from Arabic Sea brought by western winds... Worker continously tried to clean the beach but this was a kind of Sisyphean task!",1
143,"The hotel was top rate, all the staff could not do enough for you, we found the meals to be expensive in comparison to the surrounding area, but cannot comment on the standard, we visited at the end of the season so quiet everywhere we went, wasn't impressed with the quality of the food in the beach shacks and got bad stomach on several occasions, we found a taxi driver called Alvis who was very good and took us around where we wanted to go full day for around 40, overall very nice holiday spoils by missing a connecting flight on the way home.",1
144,"The hotel was a very beautiful property with lush greenery and especially the lagoons.
I was at a lagoon suite which was indeed a very big and beautiful room.
Now comes the thing.
The staff was not very good . They were unsmiling and were not able to comprehend very well. 
I would recommend taj exotica over the Leela as I stayed there 1 year back and it was a much better property or u can also choose taj fort Aguada if u are travelling with kids.",1
145,"Well there are too many reviews raving about this place and I could be just one more of them, but I would rather point out few points which could make it better for my next visit here.

1. The property is huge and somehwere I felt lost in the lagoon! With so much land to offer I feel there should be few activities thrown in just to break the journey within...if there had been few benches overlooking the lagoon or something else I dnt know. .should be thought about. Many times I felt to sit down but did not have any place to sit.

2. A leisure hotel or resort without hammock is unreal....hello they need to be propped up in key areas without asking for it.

3. A hotel in india should have a jet spray...no one wants a lesson in western culture here ;)

4. Maybe it was off season but I could not see the spirit of holidaying. 

5. Morning tea should be complimentary and meals could be more reasonably priced.

Well just to conclude I appreciate the lagoon which is a living ecosystem and well maintained with fishes, birds, snakes, frogs, tress , shrubs lotus and many other flowering and fruit bearing plants lined up everywhere... nature's delight.
The kids play centre was a blessing, pool is of good size with a hideaway tunnel and the breakfast is amazing.

And the best part my kids enjoyed the stay.

Hope to come back soon !!!",1
146,The hotel was really busy as soon as I arrived with my family. I felt like I wasn't paid enough attention but given the rush I can understand. The front desk were curious and helpful. Food and rooms were good. Overall a very satisfying stay.,1
147,"it was a pricey but good experience. good food,staff,sleep,ambiance,water,people,beer,swimming pool,boys,hash,beaches. PS: Still not out of my trip.wold love to visit again.soon, if they give discount.",1
148,Beautiful property. Very good room and decorative bathroom. The property has variety of trees and plants all over the area. The breakfast was excellent.. This was our first stay at The Leela and had great expectations of the place and I must say we were not dissapointed with it....it was a truly great experience. A must visit hotel in Goa. Will Certainly come back.,1
149,"The property is very good, conveniently located. Rooms are large and very spacious with all modern amenities. Hospitality and welcome was excellent. The spread of breakfast was best and includes everything one could imagine in 5 star restaurant breakfast . The swimming pool and gym were good to have exercise and relax. Cycling within the property was a real fun and good to burn calories. Overall very satisfying experience.",1
150,"Stayed at the Leela for 2 nights for a business meet-up. While the trip was excellent for the most part, I wouldn't go back because there's definitely other properties to choose from which are better than Leela. 

Pros - Loved their traditional welcome with flower garlands and coconut water. The property is old but its got a charm of its own. Each suite comes with a view to a beautiful pond. The food was the best part - buffet spread (all meals) were the perfect balance of Indian, Asian, Western food - and all of it good enough to tantalise your taste buds. Didn't get a chance to visit their spa, but it seemed fairly priced. 

Cons - The wifi they offer can be connected to a certain number of devices at max. I don't appreciate that considering the amount of money one pays to stay there is not cheap. Piece-meal costing for small things always annoys me - particularly when its for essential/basic things like wifi. Another downside, there's no bar within the hotel that stays open until late night. And of-course there's nothing outside of the place.",1
151,"We started with a reservation adjustment for a longer stay which they accommodated fully. We arrived to a full bell service staff helping with our bags etc. We stayed in a Lagoon Suite. Per the Leela website, it is the same room, see room description on their site. Housekeeping was amazing, room cleaned daily and a turn down service also tidied the room before bed. Room service was consistent delivering our orders, very attentive. The property has a kids club and a nanny if needed. A playground and separate kiddy pool. The golf course is 12 hole par, reasonable pricing, putting green which was fun as I was showing up my husband :) It was monsoon season so the beach was not set up with the seasonal restaurant (Nov-May) Beach was patrolled with security, well kept beach, clean, and maintained. Wonderful sunsets. Property was clean and maintained, walkable, but they did offer golf buggies if you needed them. Pool was very relaxing with towel service and a pool bar. Food we had was good but does not compare to Leela Chennai. Standard breakfast buffet served, same with lunch. Staff was very helpful with the baby and his individual needs. Overall it was a very pleasant stay ending with a longing to stay even longer. I recommend and would stay again. Maybe in the Club area for more privacy.",1
152,I must congratulate hotel authority the kind of hotel maintainable in terms of greenery they have made as it is really hard to keep that much of green in best of its state..... Staff was really cooperative and we really enjoyed our stay.... Plenty of small water bodies to take a dip..... Kids can also enjoy in different pools and kid zone..... Food was also Gud and affordable too.... Airport pick up and drop facility was available,1
153,"Everything about this resort is beautiful and lavish.. staff is courteous and it was a pleasure to interact with them.. food is good.. and almost everything about our stay was perfect..
Just don't expect to have a good time at Aqua if you plan to party.. they don't follow the schedule or the theme for the night and even if they did the place was boring (more of a recreational activity room than a lounge)
But if you want to relax and enjoy the calm surrounding this is place you would want to stay at..",1
154,"I have started writing reviews for luxury ones too. I used to avoid talking about those in past.

This is my second visit to this hotel after 8 Years and I can say it has not changed much.

Here is my review:

Location: Located in south Goa around 2 hour drive from Airport crossing villages and road is bit bumpy. If you are thinking to go to other side of Goa for partying it will take you around 3 hours.

Property: It's a big property spread over 70 acre with tropical look and feel. You will enjoy the walks and view for sure.

Rooms: Decent size rooms with option of balcony. The property is so big that few rooms are far away from reception and you have to walk a lot to reach reception/pool/beach.
Bed and bath are nice too.


Food: Food is good though not exceptional.


Staff & Service: Very helpful however you will find a delay in service on busy days/season.

Pool & Beach: A big beautiful pool which is a standard for these kind of properties. Beach is around 200 meters walk from Pool\garden area. I don't think this is a private beach but access to this beach is very close from hotel.

Amenities: Gym, pool for kids, nice restaurants.

Overall this is ideal place for couples and corporate events.",1
155,"We visited The Leela, Goa in September 2016 for 3 nights from 10th to the 13th. 
Plus points:
Fantastic service, with a smile. 
Property is clean and maintained, fit for Gods. 
Food was good, though would have appreciated more variety in fish and beef dishes. 
Staff is courteous, be it the kids play area, the breakfast or lunch staff or house keeping.

Looking forward to our next visit again. ",1
156,The welcome was good. The rooms very small for the price they charge. They need more golf carts to cater in house guests. Their breakfast was simply amazing. Do try the mysore dosa. Kids activity room was fascinating. All in all a one time visit.,1
157,"This is a great hotel with large guest capacity but the greenery and architecture hide it well giving it a feel if a smaller establishment and discreetness and privacy which guests may prefer. Normal rooms overlook lotus pond, and have an independent balcony. It is quite relaxing. Lobby is stunning in the Hampi style with a lot of large stone carvings around the hotel. The hotel is more in the South Indian style and does not represent local architecture. The pool, gym and spa facilities are good. What is great is the vast beach expanse in a very quiet part of Southern Goa.",1
158,"First time to South Goa, the Leela is and Oasis of beauty. The grounds are stunning and the beach is heaven. The hotel rooms are somewhat tired and lack lustre but overcome easily by the lovely facilities the hotel has. We had a serene balcony which looked over to honeymoon island. Depending on how the wind blows you can get the smell from the river which can be quite pungent. The lobby is stunning and welcoming, the staff are attentive but don't always follow through on the Leela reputation of service. Simply it is those who have worked there for years that you see the quality of service. We did the 5 day spa package and it was great value for money and treatments first class. The actual spa area is very lovely but not exceptional as they are limited for space. No where to relax after treatment, like other leading spas, spa staff are mostly from Kerala and are fully trained in fabulous Ayurvedic treatments. Sindhi in the spa has the best smile of anyone I have ever met and her service was perfection. The personal yoga session was also a memorable experience. Be wary that the full board package limits you only to the buffet restaurant, we cancelled after we discovered this as there are so many other nice options in the hotel and outside close by. Breakfast is very hectic and buffet style, the hotel does Happy hours in various places which is nice. Jamavar restaurant was our favourite, exceptional service from Joaquin who has worked at the hotel for 25 years. Food was also stunning and the view on the terrace lovely. The suesago restaurant that is seasonal on the beach sadly lacked romance and sparkle but overall was satisfactory. The pool bar is lovely and Protus who works there really makes the difference. There was also lots of large conferences and weddings going on which others may find annoying but added entertainment for us to watch the massive set up on the lawns and beach for fully staged performances and fireworks. Overall I would recommend this resort but don't expect it to be perfection. It's a great Goa beach luxury experience that is a little rustic in parts. Next time we return we may try the club area to see how it differs in experience.",1
159,"This is a lovely hotel set in fabulous landscaped grounds next to a long secluded beach. It is fairly isolated and if you wish to visit central Goa then a taxi trip will cost you in the region of 35. However if you want piece and quiet you will enjoy it here. We arrived just as the season was starting and two privately owned shacks had just opened on the beach close to the hotel. At these you can get relatively cheap, good quality food and drink. The hotel has a number of restaurants and bars all of which are first class, however if you are not on half board it is fairly expensive to eat and buy drink here. (They do have happy hours in some of the hotel bars). Just outside the front gate ( a 2 minute walk away) is The Fisherman's Walk Restaurant which is excellent, very reasonably priced and well worth a visit.
When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised to be given access to complimentary WiFi but many of the other guests were not and were less than pleased with the additional charges. Apparently you get 30 minutes free per day then you have to pay approximately 300 Rs per hour, which for a 5 star hotel is not on. 

However, we really enjoyed our stay as this is a lovely place to chill out for the weary traveller.",1
160,"The Leela Goa is a big property with its own golf course. It's a perfect luxury experience. I had been for a biz conference and everything was properly maintained. The beach is very clean and has a long coastline, ideal for jogging. 
The Fisherman's Wharf, famous for its sea food is located just outside the Leela main gate.
Overall I had a good experience during my stay.",1
161,"The resort is very beautiful, the lakes, all the green areas, everything... and the room is very spacious and well decorated. Everything as you might expect from a high end resort.

The staff was also very friendly and always ready to help us with any request. And the breakfast was amazing.

But honestly we were hoping for a little bit more, specially when we had 85% of the beach ""closed"" due to an event there, and they were still removing the temporary building, with lots of workers there all the time (day and night).

And when the beach was one of the major reasons for us to select this place, it would be ""nice"" if the resort at least tried to compensate us a little bit, maybe with some dinner discount or even offering the wifi. But no, nothing at all.

Finally regarding the prices. We know that when we select a resort in this price range the food and other services there might be a little expensive. But we have already been to several similar places and this one was a little bit over the top, which ended up with us only having 1 dinner there. And if you wonder about doing something special with your loved one there (like a dinner in the beach), you can quickly forget about it, the price just to book the space is ridiculous...",1
162,As expected awesome hospitality. Good food. easy transit to dambolim airport. Much better place than Marriott. If you want to enjoy then you can visit arpora or calangute. a good place to stay with family or colleagues.,1
163,A very awesome hotel with all facilities and service. The hotel is located in a very peaceful area near beach and water bodies. The service and the staff were so nice.They offer variety of food and is tasty also. They have swimming pool also which a added star to hotel.,1
164,Good place n nice restaurant for the people who love to eat a variety of foods. Really the service of the hotel is really good and all the service is very fine. All the service is really good. All the staff of the hotel are very soft and kind spoke person.,1
165,"The location of the hotel is very far away from the airport, as well as the city, so if you just need to relax for some time, this might be a good option. The facilities provided are quite good and expected out of a reputable brand of hotel.
There is a huge spread of breakfast buffet which is sumptious but taste tilts towards continental. even the indian food tastes continental.
They have a clean private beach which is well maintained and they also have bicycles in case you want to explore the resort and also get some physical exercise along with it.

The rooms are well equipped if you are coming for business, and all the needs would be taken care off.

but given a choice between Taj aguada and Leela, i would anytime pick the former, Leela somehow doesn't come across as the ultimate luxury abode in Goa.",1
166,"Visited for 3 days. We are a couple with a 4 years girl and an infant. Stayed in a consortium room which is nice but a bit small for a couple with two kids. Breakfast is good, a la carte menu is great, but buffet is poor. Don't choose full board or half board options. We liked outdoor facilities a lot with a good pool and a great beach. Kids room and playground are fine although small. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this hotel.",1
167,"Had been wanting to stay at Leela since after all it's Leela- got excited and booked ourselves into the property. 
Interesting property- beautiful water bodies all over, lovely view from the room, great food but still not close to Taj when it comes to hospitality. 
The kids loved the activities and the pool (it's definitely No. 1 on their list of properties to go to in Goa), but I must say I missed the personalised greeting smiles and services offered at Taj Excotica and Holiday Village, where I just don't feel like a guest. 
Would recommend it but in case you're looking to feel truly pampered and get that wow feeling of hospitality, I would recommend Taj Exotica",1
168,The hotel is amazing in customer handling. Food is delicious and also we came across some superb friendly customer service. Staying in this hotel is really enjoyable and amazing. Good hygienic rooms and amazing view.,1
169,"This is a very good property in south Goa. We were in Goa for a week and stayed at The Leela for a weekend. The hotel has a private beach with some water sports, however the water sports are not by the hotel but locals. Nothing wrong with it. Food is good. Overall a good 5 star hotel but not giving 5 rating as in hospitality it is not the best. Anyone who has stayed with Taj will feel something lacking in hospitality. For instance we were given reminders over phone and in writing that we are to check out on so n so date. It was just not done. The guest knows the check out date and even if they have to be reminded, it can be handled better.",1
170,Supap restaurant in goa the leela ND near too all destany in Goa good service in good rooms in this hotel low cost and best five star hotel like a Raj mahel facility good pace ND I like most beautiful ND tasty it's hotel food,1
171,"Just finished a week at the Leela in Goa after attending a wedding just north of there. The hotel lobby, grounds, the rooms, the pools and the food were all fantastic. It was a top notch experience. If I had to change a couple of things it would be they seem unnecessarily obsessed with trying to sell you more on something or another. I found this to be annoying and beneath the reputation of the Leela. Only other negative was the wine storage must be a problem - We sent 5 bottles back over the course of our stay. They have some work to do there. Otherwise, the place is really special.",1
172,"The hotel and the surroundings are beautiful. The room was extremely comfortable, balcony over the lake was peaceful and relaxing. Great range of food for breakfast. With us spending 12 days traveling around India the verify of food available was great, and the food we ate in the hotel was excellent. Staff friendly and helpful. Would recommend it but be aware of a few things that disappointed us. We had to pay for wi-fi, I was already paying 250 a night free wi-fi should be available! 
We were disappointed with the trouser policy, you were able to wear shorts in the main dining hall but the Indian restaurant which is part of the hall you had to wear trousers, pointless rule!!!",1
173,"We stayed here for 3 nights and everything (almost) was perfect.
The perfect part
Right from the communication prior to traveling, to the pickup, the check-in etc, everything was flawless. My wife is expecting and they offered us a cake and wine which was really nice. Further, my wife and I were returning to different destination at the end of our stay and due to some delays in my wife's flight, they were nice enough to allow her a slightly late check-in. Most of the staff was very courteous and professional. A special thanks to Ovina who was most gracious in her dealings with us at every step.
We loved the resort which has a beautiful entrance, makes for a lovely walking path (via the spice gardens etc), the beach (the sunset and lazing on the chairs through the afternoon), cycling (30 mins of a complimentary cycle ride each day), the gym, the breakfast spread, the live music every evening in the lobby, the staff, the pool (albeit it was a bit too cold given the weather), the room (we stayed in a lagoon view room which was immaculately designed and had a nice bathroom with a nice large bath tub). The balcony overlooked the lagoon and the view from it was beautiful albeit the balconies of other rooms were visible which made privacy a slight problem but it would be a bit harsh to expect it to not be the case as once you see the lagoon, one can understand that this can't really be helped. The resort was not fully occupied (occupancy rate during our stay would be half per my understanding) which gave us more space than had it been had it been full

The not so perfect part
My only complaint (which seemed to be a sentiment shared by a German couple we met during our stay) and which seemed evident from the sight of the near empty hotel restaurants was the high pricing (especially if one grosses it up for taxes) in the hotel restaurants. it seemed almost prohibitive for me, and I personally thought it to unreasonably high tbh. Further, the all meals or half board plans (which we didn't opt for) has the option of dining only in the main restaurant and does not give an option to try out the other restaurants. This is in contrast to Leela Kovalam, where the all meals plan gave guests an option to try out other restaurants albeit with a set 3 course menu. Eventually, I felt the pricing was counterproductive and forced the guests to eat somewhere else or worse still made made dining inside the hotel seem like a rip-off, neither of which I'm sure the management really aims for. I'm not sure if this will change and in case it doesn't, may I suggest those looking for options outside the hotel to try out Betty's place which is a two minute walk from the main entrance. While it isn't as well known as its neighbouring joint ""Fisherman's wharf"", we found it to be more homely, better value for money and able to provide similar quality of dishes (the steak, and the butter garlic prawns especially)

Overall, I would recommend a stay at this magnificent property to anyone looking for a relaxed retreat into nature combined with luxury. However, I wouldn't recommend dining under current conditions for at least value conscious non-millionaires like yours truly :)",1
174,"I had one of the most memorable breakfast buffet with my husband. We are foodies, and we kept on eating for over an hour. 
We stayed at this lovely property for 2 days after 3 days busy stay in North Goa. We just wanted to relax, hence The Leela, Goa. 
The beach is cream beach, where an entire day can be spent sleeping/reading.",1
175,"We stayed at room 601 from 30-11-16 to 03-12-2016. 

Overall we had a good stay with some aspects of the hotel being good and some being plain average.

To start with the positive aspects the room is awesome. Much better than taj exotica however taj have recently renovated there rooms also. Bathroom was also massive. Wifi was quick and included in our package however I am not sure if this is available without extra charges for everybody. Spa was also excellent. Airport pick and drop off was done very well in a big and comfortable van. Some of the staff like Mantoo at the restaurant and Indirha at the reception were excellent and a asset to the hotel. The beach was good and not crowded although it was not very clean and a stray dog was always around.

The major issues we faced were with the food. We were on the all inclusive food package and this includes all meal in the buffet restaurant. We were bored eating there daily as the majority of the dishes are vegetarian. For seafood there would be one main dish and one starter. The staff did provide us with a few seafood starters. There are good restaurants within walking distance like Fishermans Wharf and we regret being tied up to the package.

Secondly there was a Bajaj event on the first and second day and a wedding event on the third day when we there. Since we were visiting with family in kids it was highly inconvenient at times. The breakfast was very crowded and some times a coffee would have to be requested three or four times before we received it. At times I felt that the hotel was catering more to events than to individual guests.

During checkin we had informed that we need a late check out since our flight was in the late evening. On the second last day we directly received a letter stating that we need to check out at 12pm. At the reception we were told that the hotel was 98% full because of the events. After some repeated request they extended the time first by 30 minutes and than by an hour. On the last day when we went to settle our bill they agreed for check out time of 3:30pm. I am not sure why they created a scenario where this seemed impossible in the first place.

Over and above I would consider this hotel if it works on the flaws since some of the staff work hard to minimize the flaws by certain staff and procedures. Having been to Taj exotica multiple times I would rate the food and service of Taj to be of a higher level than Leela.",1
176,"2 aspects- stay and food. Disappointed with stay after burning 60k for 2 night, where one fine afternoon we were humiliated and embarrassed by the staff that we were non guests at the hotel and we aren't allowed to roam inside premises. How the hell did the staff know we were non guests. Turned out to be a mistaken identity when confronted with the management team, though the damage was enough to raise a question mark on governance and policy of the hotel where they themselves aren't sure of their own guests or visitors. This was highlighted to the GM who was kind enough to send us the bottle of sparkling wine as an apology. Staying in Leela was anyway a second option compared to Taj which unfortunately was booked for the dates when we travelled and only have reinforced our decision not to choose The Leela, where there is a saying- first impression is the last impression. 

Secondly we had taken option of lunch or dinner, where we tried lunch on one day and dinner on the second where the food was very oily and this is something least expected. Breakfast is something we liked.

Maybe i am the unfortunate one who went thru this ordeal.",0
177,"We visit such places to relax and enjoy .. but there was this event to be conducted and for that reason they were doing maintenance work .. polishing the floor, polishing the bridge and the construction work was going all around.. it was so disturbing .. the noise.. due to high alert and international event there was a security.. number of army guards , and other members from the event management committee were roaming around.. in short it was so crowded. 
We were expecting a nice private beach but because of this event and security concerns they limited the beach .. and again there was construction going on . We are very disappointed with this trip. 
Other things like room ..food was up to date .. 
the only thing where i get some quiet time was the kids play room .. 
Other than this was so noisy, crowded and disturbing.
I know this event is important and it is also important to prepare and present ourselves but they must have to inform this at the time of booking because its a costly trip .. 

Thank you.",0
178,"As my experience was bad i will narrate that first

Cons: 
When we entered our room the fruit tray was empty despite our room was handed over to us after 40 min as they were making it and we had to wait in lobby, But thats ok as later they placed it in our room when we went for lunch.
After lunch, when we were having siesta our door bell rang 3 times, finally i had to shout and yell that ""we are sleeping"".
Again the door bell rang after few hours on opening the door two guys standing on the door, one in police kind of a uniform and other a hotel guy giving a letter about checkout timing and asking if we need airport drop despite i had clearly given the details at the time of checkin to the incharge about our airport plan as we had our own car and had told that we will checkout at morning 10 a.m.
After two hours it rang again and there was someone again at the door to place things in room with a security guard. First time i had seen in a hotel where you see two people come on your door. Both of them entered to place it.
Next day in the morning when we wanted to check out, our door got jammed and we could not open it through our room key card, neither the master card with the housekeeper could open it. Finally a metal key was bought to open it this delayed things and we had to wait for 20 min. to get out luggage out.
The pool is very small for a 200 key hotel, other hotels i have stayed in Goa have huge pool where you can get some privacy especially when you are travelling as couple like Park Hyatt and Zuri where I had stayed earlier.
I found the approach of some staff not very polite.
My overall experience was not as i expected from a brand like Leela.


Pros : Breakfast spread was very nice and elaborated.",0
179,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights. Totally disappointed by the service of staff here. Following are the reasons for disappointment:

1. Understaffed: Right from valet to waiters to house keeping, there seems to be a shortage of people serving the guests. I had to wait 20 mins for my car to be brought from parking which was 2 mins away from the lobby. The driver didn't know how to drive an AT and there was ONLY one driver manning the valet counter.
We had to wait another 20 mins for the buggy to pick us up from pool area to drop us to the room in heavy rains. 

2. Attitude of the staff: They all tend to ignore you rather than offer help. While looking for umbrella, three of the staff members saw us but none of them offered help. In fact they themselves were using umbrella when guests had none left in the bucket. The attendant at breakfast asked me to speed up as they were closing down the buffet. Asking this is fine but in the manner they tell you is very cheap and comparable to a 2 star hotel.

3. Breakfast: I have been to many 5 star and 7 star hotels; never have I seen that the chefs are not having assistant to take orders. The dosa counter chef was working alone and had no one to take notes of orders. This was causing delays. Also, some of the counters are so far away from where one gets to sit, it is a task to get the food to table and still have it hot. The idli counter had no chutney and one needs to go to dosa counter to get it. Unbelievable. Again the feeling of this hotel being understaffed is evident when one has to wait forever to get attention of waiters.

4. Buggy service: one has to be lucky to get the buggy to travel back to your room from beach. Almost always it takes more than 30 mins to get one.

5. Baby pool: No shower near the baby pool. One needs to go the main pool for shower even if using the baby pool. How hard it is to have another shower near this pool when you have 78 acres of land?!

6. Reminding you that you have to leave the hotel: Right from check-in, the staff keeps reminding you that the check-out is at noon and that you are leaving on so and so day. I understand that they want to arrange the transport but then why during check-in??! Also, I told them twice that I have my own vechile but they seem to have no co-ordination at all - very poor show for a 5 star hotel (or is it 7 star?!)

The only good thing we found, other than the spacious and comfortable room, is the clean beach and greenery. The beach which is so called private has salesmen all over it. The watchmen seem to have some arrangement with them as they never object the selling. Also, don't be surprised to see dogs on the beach (so much so for the ""private beach"").

A complete no - no for another visit to this hotel....",0
180,"You can find much better Hotel in Lower Prices.
I checked in on 15th June in Conservatory Room with my wife and Son and was welcomed by a LIZARD in the room.
Next morning we planned for swimming but the Pool was DIRTY 
Restaurant is totally mismanaged 
You will be very Lucky to find a table as the sitting is not enough 
Menu is poor 
You can't sit near the Pool or Garden in the evening as lot of Mosquitos are there.
The Property is very beautiful but with this management will not last long.",0
181,"We checked into The Leela after having a great stay at The Taj Vivanta, Fort Aguada and realised vast difference in service. An example, the moment we entered into the restaurant, we were served water without asking but in the leela, we had to plead multiple times, seems that they are under staff and untrained staff. 

The good variety is also not great. Though the property is huge but the finesse and courtesies is completely missing. 

We stayed at the Conservatory Room.

Finally I would never prefer to stay in this property provided they improve their service. 

Thanks.",0
182,"A good hotel managed very poorly. A big thumps down to the staff. The dress they wear, specially in the Restaurant gives you the impression that you are not in a hotel but in a govt. hospital. The restaurant manager is a big liar. He will promise you everything but will not fulfill any. They do not take proper care of the customer belongings. Rates are exorbitantly high but it does not match the service provided. The only thing they take good care of is the payment you are suppose to make. I have vowed not to visit this hotel again even if they are free of cost and will suggest all my friends and acqintances to stay in any of the many other hotels in the list.",0
183,"My wife and I booked at this hotel after some days in north Goa and to celebrate our anniversary. When we arrived everything seemed perfect, but the perfection was quickly dispelled with rather long check-in procedure. Of course the hotel took note of our anniversary (the next day). We made a reservation at the beachside restaurant (the Riverside restaurant was fully booked with a corporate event) and were assured 'something appropriate would be arranged'. 

We asked for a quiet room but we were accommodated near the hotel entrance close to the road. The room dcor was rather dark with a slightly damp smell. 

The next evening we dined at the beachside restaurant and no special arrangements had been made. The fish was overpriced. The food in general was rather poor and definitely not 5-star, the breakfast was particularly disappointing and in-line with 3 star hotel. Leela management should take the time to investigate a true 5 star hotel experience such as the Fourseasons. 

On the plus side the hotel staff on the beach were very good, the beach itself is clean and well maintained. 

Rather strangely as we left the hotel and had checked out, the hotel delivered a chocolate cake and champagne - the worst possible timing, it was hot and we were departing for the airport. We gave it back to them. 

Overall an uneven experience and not in line with my previous experiences at the Leela Palace in New Delhi. Would I return - No.",0
184,"Visted this hotel in late January 
First time in Goa 
Where to start 
The room was very nice but that far away from the reception that we had to get a golf buggie to take us back to the room 
The pool was a bit cold and as we thought for that time of year it would have been heated 
Nice gardens but I am not a Gardner ? The sun beds were 30 meters from the sea edge 
In all the hotel was set in a lonesome area which had nothing going on and ever night we were in bed by 11pm
It advertise a disco but it was not open and no other entertainment in there

Very quiet ? Too quiet most people were50 years old and above not suitable for the middle age group",0
185,"The core of a chain runs through its properties - like the hospitality of Taj stands out across its hotels - similarly at one hand the magnamity of the hotels stand out for Leela at one hand , the inconsistency of the service remain the same which means that in a service sector you cannot just thrive by just good infrastructure 

Our stay currently on at Leela goa symbolises just that inconsistency - great room service coupled with a poor concierge !! A five star hotel that cannot manage a good all round service is a disaster to my mind 


Another sad area is the highly transactional nature of the hotel - unaccomodating to the departure times of guests and dealing with the situation by flinging a rate card or ensuring you are told of a high penalty charge on late return of a movie!! I mean just compare this to Taj where a movie is served to your room once you browse it in room not at the lobby and you have a complimentary service of a Coke and popcorn to go with it - costs hardly anything to the hotel but world class service for the consumer !! And Leela goes to the other extreme !!

Probably it does not mean much to Leela to retain guests I guess

186,"My husband and I visited India 2 years back...so this review is a little late, however I still remember how excited we were to visit Leela Goa based on the good reviews. But once we checked in and saw our room we were very disappointed. The a/c barely worked and the room while large was sparsely decorated. When we approached the management about our dissappointment, we were itold we are welcome to leave, which we did immediately.",0
187,"The Property is Beautiful with a great looking golf course and almost private white sand beach.....The free transfer from the airport to the hotel took almost 2 hrs. thus we missed our lunch...was it on purpose?... The welcome was good and the check in was quick.... But being a big hotel and the rooms at one end and all the facilities at other we needed buggy which was never free or available... The buffet menu was less than a page and was almost same all the time, no choice.... There was no cleaning or making up of the room for 2 days... Humidity was felt in the room with the smell, no fragrance.... Basic essentials like dental kits and shaving kits were missing... And on and on

All in all a bad experience... A rating of 2 only for the beautiful property and quick check in and check out....",0
188,".. Rooms ok .. Service ok .. in area food could be better ..!!..
Prices a little higher than should be .. beach services not as promised .. generally I would say it could be better, family was not so impressed and frankly I would like to try something else next time will visit Goa ..!!..",0
189,Stayed with family in 2 suites plus 2 rooms. All the rooms had similar challenges . The luxury resort must fix the cooling in their rooms and buggy service. The restaurants need to improve their service . They miss touch of luxury resort.,0
190,"We stayed here from 18-22 feb 2015 with our little less than two yr old baby. 

First 
The property is beautiful and the architects have made the best use of lagoons and landscape. The lobby and the entrance both are well detailed accessorized and look great and so do the rooms!! 
Our view was fantastic with an extra seating area with glass wall (we paid for everything) overlooking the lotus plantation. 

BUT
The big but is the staff and the policies that are a massive turn off. Right from the super quick rooms cleaning jobs with all the dust that remains on the bedroom benches to the curt ways of refusing to be forthcoming for any unusual requests (in our case one was slim milk, I am allergic to whole milk so when asked the room service to get a glass was curtly told that we only have amul taaza ) 
I walked out of the hotel to the a grocery store 100 Mtrs away and got the milk pack

More than just that the whole demeanor of the staff (barring a couple of them) screams ""not welcome"" 
This is the only luxury hotel where I have seen blank faces who look thru you standing behind the reception and the concierge. 
The least you can do is smile!! 


Food 
We mostly ordered room service (average) and once had superb food at their Italian restaurant by the river side

The buffet for breakfast also had average not a leela kind of selection but the buffet at dinner that we tried once was one of the worst meals I have ever had. Right from the selection to the tastes. Everything pathetic. 
This place is perfect for foreigners who are treated a notch up even by the guards who will wish them walking ten feet ahead of you and ignore you completely. 

I don't even want to mention the trouble we had to get some food organized for our baby. 

The hospitality is a huge disappointment and have no idea where this attitude stems from. We are connoisseur club members with leela and gurgaon leela has always been very courteous. And we paid a bomb for this crap!! 

:( ",0
191,"The property is beautifully designed and well maintained. We had our rooms close to the main facilities which is perfect. The rooms are large enough for 2 persons. The food is excellent. Huge selection at the breakfast buffet for both Indian and international guests. The ventilation in the bathroom is insufficient and needs improvement. Nevertheless I would rate these facilities with 5 stars if there were no issues regarding the location of the resort. 

Disappointing is that there is no beach service during the monsoon. However, due to the location of the property next to a large creek to our opinion swimming in the sea is not possible. One should realize that in India effluent water is mostly disposed of without treatment. The sea is heavily polluted with garbage and feces (presumably human excrements). If you like to swim in the sea in India it is recommended to find a resort away from cities and rivers mouths. Note that garbage may not be visible after the monsoon, discharging waste water will continue all year around.",0
192,"Last of the 7 hotels we stayed in and the worst, apart from The Leela in Udaipur which we moved out of after one night....unfortunately not an option here.

Room was a Lagoon suite which was large and comfortable, decor modern and bland.

Breakfast was okay but get there early otherwise there is no service and far too crowded. Did not eat in hotel, did not want to take the risk!

Pool area was noisy and crowded so long trek to the beach but remember to take water from the room as not provided, unlike every other hotel we stayed in. 

Very poor service for a supposed 5 star....did enquire about the club rooms but it appeared that for the considerable extra cost we got high tea (not evening cocktails), breakfast in the room and some free laundry and a car transfer which we did not require.

I haven't covered everything that was annoying but suffice to say I would certainly not stop at any Leelas again.",0
193,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. 

The first night was absolutely amazing from the checkin to the walk on the beach to everything. The staff was absolutely amazing and very very polite and helpful and always haf a smile on their face when attending.

The second night was good and everything was smooth. Though around 4 am in the morning I wad awoken by some rattling noise. I thought nothing of it and went back to sleep then i heard it again. I turned on the lights to inspect and I wad shocked to see a tail of some creature dangling out of the Ac vents. This completely shook me. I called the front desk and they took sometime understandably to reach.


But once again when they
reached they were all polite and helped me move to the other room.

So there it is. I really do not know what to make of this stay. It was good overall but this major incident left a very bad stay in my memory.",0
194,"Me & my family stayed in another resort close to Leela and decided to have our dinner at The Leela. OMG, we were in for a shock! We were treated like second class citizens by the staff and security. Definitely, a bunch of folks with attitude problems. The whole experience was so bad that we decided to get out of the hotel without dinner.",0
195,"I would like to share my experience in Leela.

I stay in this property this week only and celebrated my Birthday. the service which they offered was excellent. but sorry to say after spending so much the airport transfer was horrible in coach.

The A/C was not working, when we complained about this to drive and his helper.... they told us that it will work like this only, AC is automatic as per them but literally that 1 hour for airport was horrible.

I would request please not to book Leela if they are providing Coach transfer. you feel cheated as we had spent thousands of Rupee in Leela.

Its horrible experience ever in transfers. 

Please Please avoid this Hotel if they are providing Coach Transfers",0
196,"We are regulars to south Goa on business/social trips, on this occasion we were staying in Cavelossim and decided to have dinner at The Leela. As one guest writes below Leela is devoid of any culture especially for such a large establishment, this is rather true. We ordered drinks at the open lounge area, if you havent been here this is an exceptional area but its let down by lack of social ambiance, perhaps all guests were sleeping at dinner time or had gone out. 

Excellent bar service with complementary selection of nibbles provided with drinks whilst listening to the Tabla duo.

We were having Indian so walked through the buffet area (noted flies on deserts and pointed that out to girl who was escorting us, she just politely smiled). The restaurant wasn't busy two couples plus us two and a table of four who were sitting outside but were having a buffet. Rather surprisingly the simple order of mixed kebabs and baby sweetcorn took a long time, soon after we were asked if we were ready for mains !! ah no. My wife did not like them as they seem to be undercooked, the baby sweetcorn was deliciously described but it came out with thick batter and without any yogurt dressing, I am heavily into food but the slow service and food not as described is awful regardless of if your Indian or another nationality.

As this is a review, the issues are; cold plates are being served to guests, food is barley hot, the delicately battered corn is covered in thick pakora batter, no yogurt on the salad, kebabs are okay but not fantastic, the mains were disappointing as the starters, since when did all dishes have cream ? the buffet may have been better, minus the fly trodden deserts. 

I did complain to the waiter who called the manager, and guess what he called the chef over. As the chef was there we had a chat about the quality of his food, I did mention there was no yogurt on the dish, his answer was the yogurt comes from outside and is sour these days, what really chef ? so The Leela cant make the simplest of the Indian ingredients (yogurt). The chef was rather apologetic and offered us further dishes which we declined, we were not there for free food. I did inform the chef about some restaurants in London I am associated to and how we serve food. This is not 5* food, I suggest dress down and eat in a shack instead. 

With some thought I am rating the service average & food poor, I am sorry if this reflects on your overall score, its great if your quality has improved since. 

Booked 28th Feb for Dinner only, your Chef has my name. The Leela please leave an email address if you want to discuss quality of food and service, I hope it improves, perhaps next time can spend some time with your chef if you allow.",0
197,This resort is very beautiful but management must have a very weird sense of service and making people feel welcome and special. The team around the pool may as well treat it like a museum. My well behaved teenagers couldn't even throw a soft ball to each other in the pool even when there was no one else in the pool and I was there watching them. No drinking water or anything else that should be made available at a resort of this level. Pick up transfer vehicle is just terrible. Concierge wasn't at all helpful and didn't really offer any advice. She didn't even remind us to take umbrellas during monsoon on a trip that she organised. The Italian restaurant was very nice and staff terrific but the first night we went there we were the only people there. Lastly we used the gym every evening and staff were more intent on acting as security guards rather than providing any advice or assistance. So I just feel management need to empower staff more and give them a bit of space to actually help guests and make them feel a bit special. I felt the whole culture of the place reflected an attitude that I didn't see or feel in any other of the 5-6 star hotels that I stayed at in India on my recent trip. The Italian restaurant was the only difference and it would be interesting to see if they perhaps outsource the management of this to someone else. I wouldn't go back which is a pity as it is a lovely property.,0
198,"Just returned from Goa yesterday, we stayed at Leela Goa. This was my 3rd trip to Goa. 

Hotel has airport pickup, but Ac on bus was pathetic we were sweating by the time we reached the hotel.
Place is huge and rooms are good with nice ambience
There are water bodies outside all rooms, which causes mosquitos, you cant leave the room open at all.
Only one kids channel on the tv, no pogo channel, so if you are travelling with Kids and they are chota bheem fans carry some cds.
Buffet was good, with a decent number of options. Nice desserts.
No playing allowed in the swimming pools, no softball also. No floats provided near the pools.
They have a good beach near the resort, with recliners which is good.
If you are planning on parcelling meals for your return trip from the resort, be specific else the quantity packed will be less and also they dont pack things properly so do check. I had got sandwhich packed for my return journey and they packed them pretty messily and also the quantity packed was less.

Overall not very happy with my experience there, my experience with Taj in Goa was much much better compared to this, although their property is smaller than that of Leela.",0
199,"The pictures of the rooms,are not any of the rooms that we took. Nowhere near the standard of the Leela in Delhi. This hotel needs to have a star or two taken of. The staff on the other hand were very good. Spend your money somewhere else",0
200,"Quite unarguably one of India's best luxury properties till about 7-8 years ago, this hotel has now fallen on bad times. My views are based on the fact that it is an expensive hotel, and hence expectations are very high. When I am paying about $400 a nigh in a hotel in India then I expect a world class property with service levels to match. I had stayed at the hotel 6-8 years back and hence, was very surprised to see the decline. Firstly, I was in a room where the bathroom is the size of a closet, and no matter which way you turn you bang into a glass door or partition. There is barely enough place to stand and brush your teeth or shave. My colleague complained about this and he was moved to a room with a very spacious bathroom - obviously, the hotel has fallen into the trap of mediocrity (will do something if the guest raises a stink). Secondly, on the second day my room was not cleaned till 3:30pm. The General Manager, when asked why this was the case, responded that cleaning starts only at 10am and it goes into the afternoon as well. Thirdly, the gym had floor mats that were layered with dirt (from peoples shoes). Dont think these are ever cleaned. I could not use them. The GM offered to change them (and they were next day). Same issue, If I could see the dirt then how come the hotel staff could not? Fourthly, there was no newspaper on the first day. The GM had the audacity to claim that ""their records showed it had been delivered"", perhaps insinuating that I was either lying or had somehow made my newspaper disappear. Fifthly, the blinds in my room, the ones that are on a verandah that overlooks a lagoon, were layered with dust. I happened to lean against them and had stripes of dust on my white shirt. Sixthly, I had asked for soya milk at breakfast and 4 persons behind the counter told me that they did not have any. The GM said that I should have asked the Restaurant Manager. I don't know why the entire staff in the restaurant cannot be made aware of such a simple thing (soya milk is no longer an esoteric drink but staple at all top-end hotels). Lastly, the bathrooms on the ground floor (next to the ball room) were cleaned infrequently with tissue papers all over the floor and urinals flowing over. The ball room had carpets that were musty and door frames that were dilapidated. 

On the positive side - excellent food, very wide variety; lovely beach; fantastic property spread across acres and acres; far away from the maddening crowds of Goa; great choice of sports (tennis, golf etc); all rooms opening into a lagoon (I could just sit there for hours hearing the birds).

On balance, I would never go to Leela again. If I am paying top dollar then I expect nothing but the best and I have seen that at the Hyatt in Goa as well as plenty of other hotels in India (including the Leela in Delhi).",0
201,"I guess when one makes a reservation with a 5 star property, there are some pre - conceived notions one carries , all the more so if one has visited the property before and had a great time!!!
Leela Goa, I must say was a stark contrast to the earlier version when I had visited previously. 

The property still continues to be a beautiful paradise - more so in the monsoons with lush greenery, beautiful settings and freshly done up rooms. What killed the whole experience is the overall approach of staff! Housekeeping was a joke - with the staff talking over an hour and half to address a 'make my room' request! SPA slot bookings done from beforehand have no gurantee of being honoured at the said time!!! Welcome drinks n cake were 3 hrs after we checked in!!! Wrong calls into the room... honestly a jinxed experience! So much for being categorised as a 'Handle with Care (HWC) ' guest! 

There were some positives too..cant be all negative - Food was superlative, bar was a great experience and SPA was a treat! 

Summing it all up, The Leela Goa team has to pull up their socks up in terms of meeting guest requests and ensuring that they are pampered to the extent that it promises!",0
202,"This place didn't get the little things right.

The feeling of tip hustlers, bad waiter co-ordination on a very special day, mediocre food, average breakfast spread (a first for a large property like this one), unrelaxed late checkout policy, motel-like spa with old plastic doors, no casual seating, reading area or warm tea. 

This place just didn't get it right at all.",0
203,"The Resort: The Leela resort is huge but maintenance was clearly an issue. The lawns were not manicured properly and the lighting at night was very very poor and absolutely missing at the beach.
Rooms: we stayed in the conservatory premiere room. The furnishing was very modern and the feel of the room was very nice.
Food: the food quality of the buffet was quite poor and not upto five star standards at all. On the other hand the experience in the Italian resturaunt was great. Also there is a nice riverside resturaunt just outside the hotel - the fisherman's wharf - good food, ambience and reasonably priced.
Service: check-in experience was horrible. We arrived at 12:30 as the booking voucher from cleartrip mentioned checking at 12. We were told we would have to wait till 2 as all the rooms were full. After that we were taken to a twin bed room even though we had booked a double. We finally managed to check in at 3. Also, we were eligible for an upgrade due to one of our memberships but were told at the checkin counter that the hotel is booked out - even though online they were showing availability. Would have preferred if it was a more reasonable explanation than the check in manager lying blatantly.
Transportation/ location : the Leela resort is located really south in south goa. However, water sports was open in the river near Leela ( the water looks dirty though) whereas it's closed in the sea everywhere else in the monsoons.
Overall it was quite disappointing. We had stayed at the Leela resort in Kovalam and had a fantastic experience there - which is why we decided to check their Goa property as well. We also stayed at the Park Hyatt just before we stayed here and had a much much better experience there",0
204,"We have just got back from a long weekend at the Leela in Goa which left us with little desire to go back. The entrance to the property was impressive and the hotel grounds were very pretty and well maintained (much more so than the Taj Exotica). However, the service within the hotel by hotel staff was well below standard. That being said, the staff at the front desk and housekeeping were very helpful (although our bedsheets always smelt of damp and on one day were dirty and did not get changed despite informing housekeeping).

The hotel has a few restaurants but the only restaurant which serves food throughout the day is the coffee shop. The breakfast buffet was cold. Food we ordered failed to come. We went there for dinner and our steaks took over an hour to come during which time no-one bothered to ask whether we needed anything or provided an explanation as to why it was taking so long. The entire time we were there the salt and pepper shakers were constantly dirty with food stuck on them. The staff were just not very helpful at all and seemed to be wandering around not really knowing what they were meant to be doing.

At the beach there was only one attendant despite the fact that the hotel and beach were extremely busy. It was very difficult to firstly find the attendant and then to get his attention to actually get you some towels - expect it to take around 5 minutes. The beach menu was not very extensive and the only things on the menu worth eating were the fries and chocolate ice cream. 

In all honesty I really would have overlooked all the above and not bothered writing a review on tripadvisor had I not encountered the absolutely worst service of my life at the Spa. We visited the Spa on the day at the start of our stay and it was fine - nothing to rave about but it was a normal massage. However, on the day of our departure we decided to try another massage. The therapist I was given took me the changing room, showed me a locker and gave me a towel to wrap around myself (when we had the first massage I was given a robe, slippers and disposable pants), I was not provided with anything more than a towel. When I asked her she told me to take my pants off which I was not comfortable with so I told her I would keep my own on. The massage, which was meant to be a full body massage including the head was terrible - the word massage can't even be used. She simply rubbed oil on my body in repetitive long motions on my arms legs stomach and back and painfully scrubbed oil in my hair and then gave me my towel again and that was the end! When I reached the changing rooms I saw that my underpants had oil all over them. As they were very expensive I asked the masseuse how I should remove the oil and she simply laughed and said 'I don't know'. When I reached the reception of the Spa they asked me how my massage was, to which I replied 'terrible' and again their response was to laugh. I proceeded to explain everything and they simply handed me the bill the sign and said maybe it would come out with water. There was no apology at all. When I asked to speak to the manager they called the sitting Doctor who was also in the Spa who also had no apology to offer but simply said he would speak to the girl, and then proceeded to bumble back into his surgery! I have never in my life seen such terrible service, and it seemed to epitomise the general unprofessional nature of most of the staff at hotel. Upon our departure I briefly explained this to the hotel manager who did seem concerned but that won't change our trip!

We stopped at the Park Hyatt on our way to the hotel and we were truly impressed. The hotel is beautiful and the food and service at the coffee shop was impeccable. We will definitely be staying there on our next visit to Goa!",0
205,"We read such good reviews of the Leela and were excited to stay there. We aren't usually the kind of people who care a huge amount about customer service but we were immediately taken aback when we arrived when, en route to our room, we asked the concierge if there were any romantic activities we could do at the Leela as we were on our honeymoon and she simply said 'no'. We were further perplexed when that evening we saw a couple having dinner at a private candlelit table on the beach! When we enquired the next day as to whether there were any activities we could do in the area or trips we could take, the concierge again simply said 'no - there's nothing to do'. I said that I had read about all sorts of boat trips in our travel guide, could they help us organize one? ""There are boat guys on the beach if you want to ask them'. The concierge told me. When I did ask them they had astronomical prices for short boat trips. There are several restaurants scattered around the hotel but they don't give you menus for them in your room, so you have no idea which you would want to go to. When we called the concierge to ask for menus; it took them over 2 hours to bring them - and when they did they brought us only one! It was quite astonishing. Finally after desperation was beginning to sink in, one concierge told us that if we took a cab to nearby hotel 'mike's place' in cavelossim; they would help us organize some activities. This they did - and helped us arrange a boat trip and a tour of the area. It's a traveller hotel, and frankly should not be so superior to the Leela in its standards of service - but it was. At the Leela restaurants, the waiters studiously practiced the 'upsell' ('would you like desert?' 'no', 'are you sure, maybe just some ice cream?' 'no thank you', 'what about some creme caramel?' 'no!!!') to the point where you felt like you were being harassed! When we finally checked out of the leela and told the manager what happened, she did apologize profusely and arrange for us to get a 'really nice room' at the Leela in Mumbai; however when we checked in at the Leela Mumbai they showed us to what can only have been one of their worst rooms with absolutely no view except a neighbouring car park. We had to complain again! Finally when we checked out of that hotel and asked to join the Leela Kempinski rewards programme and get points for the nights we'd stayed in Goa and Mumbai; they said we could not reclaim those nights past - which seemed ridiculous. Altogether, even though the Leelas are very attractive hotels - they need to work hard on their customer service! The only high point in service at the Leela Goa was the head barman at the beach bar, who was extremely friendly, not at all pushy, helpful and made a terrific cocktail. He had apparently been sent for training in Orlando - something which the Leela might consider sending other staff to do also. Maybe they don't want you to leave the property so you spend more money there - I assume that's the idea. They do have a very pretty beach area, but while the hotel calls it a 'private beach', it is filled with hawkers who accost you whenever you go into the ocean. The room is also lovely and we had no complaints about that at all. It's just a shame we had so much trouble doing anything outside of it!",0
206,"its was a pleasant start to a desasterous end.. roms had shower problems , airconditioning did not work to the fullest. staff was helpfull but i had to move twice in my 3 day stay which did not appeal to me.",0
207,"The first Night we couldn't sleep a wink, because of insects making noise outside our door..... We changed our room the next day, only to find a lizard between the sheets in our bed.... TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS... very poor housekeeping...

Though the spa is excellent and the property offers load of great things to keep you busy... excellent location and beach too....

Breakfast was very ordinary, not 5 star standards. Their RIVERSIDE restaurant was awesome with live music and gourmet cuisine...

The CASINO was pathetic. !!! 

would not recommend if you are looking for luxury. Else this hotel kept us busy with tone of stuff...

Liked  The Beach
Disliked  The lizard between my bedsheets",0
208,"I never thought Id find myself saying this upon returning from the Leela Goa but Im glad to have left and wont be staying here ever again. Its not too much to say I wouldnt stay here again for free. This is a reasonably nice hotel with OK facilities but worrying management. I booked a long weekend with my wife, arriving on a Thursday and departing on a Sunday.

We booked a Lagoon Suite which was two rooms, one living room and one bedroom overlooking a man made lagoon. The room was nice but a little dated. The two TVs were ancient and as is becoming more and more prevalent in top end hotels the TV reception was rubbish.

Aside from the Caf there were 3 other restaurants. One served Indian food, one served Italian/seafood and the other down on the beach served seafood/burgers etc. We ate at the Indian restaurant and the seafood restaurant and found both to be reasonable. Neither will serve the best food you have ever eaten, both are unlikely to make you ill.

Down the beach from the hotel (30 meters) there are three beach restaurants serving food at far more reasonable prices. We would have tried them had we not been on an all inclusive deal. Given the emptiness of the restaurants in the hotel each evening this must have been where people went to eat.

My major issue with the hotel came towards the end of my stay. I appreciate times are tight for the hotel industry but my stay was ruined by the arrival of 30 men from a large telecommunications company holding some kind of conference. This resulted in this group lying around on the grass drinking, monopolistic the pool, shouting, drinking and generally making a nuisance of themselves. Complaints to the management elicited responses such as its hard to control a large group of men or ..but they are all from a top company. The hotel was clearly far more interested in making sure that these 30 men had the run of the hotel causing whatever havoc they chose at the expense of the other guests.

This has left a very bad taste in my mouth. I spent a significant amount of money for the three nights I was there and came second in terms of priority to the drunken idiots in the eyes of the management. Its a shame. Having stayed at other Leela hotels in the world the management at this one really let the side down.",0
209,"It was good value for money. Nice amenities, good food and suitable location. Easy access to important tourist places.",0
210,"Were disappointed from GHM Hotels after we had an amazing stay at the Legian in Bali
Service:
Part of the staff was on strike and therefore quality of service suffered and negative atmosphere. Room wasn't cleaned on some days. No turn down service. Had the feeling that the personnel in lower positions were not treated well.

Rooms:
Small. More like a 4 Star hotel. Parts were dated. Bathroom: average

Breakfast:
food was good. Staff friendly and helpful

Lobster Shack:
Great staff and food.

Concierge/Beauty Salon/Reception:
useless, lazy, slow, incompetent

Pool/Beach:
slow service. Beach was on particular days dirty.

General : Very inconsistent. Not a 5 star hotel! but probably still better than the Taj. You will be very disappointed if you have stayed at another GHM hotel or at an Oberoi in India before.

Sent a letter to the General Manager but never received a response.",0
211,"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon. Having spent the previous 3 days in Dubai at Jumeriah Beach we were expecting a similar experience- wrong I`m afraid.
Firstly there was significant building work- the pool cafe was closed for 2 days, ugly green partitions were dotted everywhere and many of the villas looked like a building site (with sawing and banging to match). We did complain to our rep and were moved to a quieter villa.
Although the hotel staff were nice and accommodating i just didn`t get the same feeling as I did in Dubai. 
Also the prices at the resort are astoundingly expensive, certainly not value for money- if you plan to eat in and also have a few cokes / water during the day then at least 200 a day for a couple!
On the plus side, was very quiet and beach wonderful.

Liked  beach
Disliked  value for money",0
212,"It is reckoned to be the best hotel in Goa. Well god help Goa. My wife and I had a great holiday and the hotel is pleasant enough. The beach is outstanding and the crowd we met there was charming. However I had to major issues with my stay that for me remain the salient memory of the hotel (though fortunately not the holiday). Bear in mind this is a professional business run by those concerned by market forces. It attests to being 5 star. First there is the service. Everything they (the grunt staff) did, they did with a smile. Everything they did they gushed with helpfulness. Everything gratitude we expressed they beamed with satisfaction. Everything they did was wrong. I don't think I ordered a single item that didn't in some way come with something lacking. Perhaps this is an Indian phenomenan. I had the same experience in Bombay at the Taj Palace. If you want something done then ask three people and hope that one of them does it. Ok, no big deal, and it wouldn't have been had it not been for point 2. 

Management were forever hosting evenings that 'starred' various singers or bands. Now its not as if Goa is short of talent. Just outside the hotel was a restaurant called 'Betty's Place'. They had a fantastic band and I mean 'good' by London standards. The food at Betty's was remarkable and the price likewise. I think we ate the River Sal's supply of crab for the season and it cost the same as a pack of fags. However at the Leela it cost (for India) the equivalent of a year's salary. Now I have no problem paying high prices, even over the top prices. But I do have a problem with being 'sold' a grand night out and finding out that the 'grand' refers to the bill. I complained about one particular evening where we served ourselves at the buffet only to find that as we sat down the most terrifying shrieks that only someone undergoing unanaethetised surgery on their groin could possibly make. Either that or a band at the Leela hotel. 

The fact is that I came away feeling I'd been sold to the whole time. Always being pitched at for one event or another. each of which was just plain amateurish, albeit it that it was accompanied by the most professional of prices. And when I complained they did nothing! They may respond and say they knocked a breakfast off my bill. That was because when I ordered egg, toast and tea for breakfast only the eggs arrived. 

Conclusion. The hotel is atrociously managed and avaricious. It lets Goa, the beach and its staff down. Go there by all means but eat out as much as you can and avoid anything the hotel offers.

Liked  The beach, thye sea, the dolphins
Disliked  Always trying to figure out how to squeeze you for another rupee
Tips/Secrets  Eat at Betty's place and Martin's Corner",0
213,"The Leela gardens and beach are still as beautiful as ever. The staff pleasant and attentive. The food in the restaurants good. However since the advent of GHM as management the decor in public areas and bedrooms in the main hotel is drab and dull and maintenance ignored.
The Club may be new and glitzy but the hotel accommodation although ""top dollar"" prices is now old, leaking, and shabby. Water ingress in Lagoon Suite Rooms ($485 per night) leads to paint staining and damp smell. Roof tiles are perished and a quick splash of paint simply won't do.
The Spa building leaks and there is damp plaster and staining on walls and ceilings. The ladies' changing room toilets smell of urine.
The gym may sport 2 new treadmills but the air con is ineffective and the window frames show bubbling plaster and staining.
It is sad to see what was once an immaculate hotel when Four Seasons and Kempinski managed now so run down.

Liked  The size and layout of the Lagoon Suite
Disliked  the poor maintenance, water ingress, noisy air con, dull furnishings, poorly maintained window frames and dated tile floor
Tips/Secrets  It is not up to scratch for the prices charged.",0
214,"I was looking forward to the Leela. I was dissapointed. The Hotel is tired and worn out. On arrival, the reception is impressive but the feeling soon fades away. We have two young children and had booked adjoining rooms. The management decided that our 8 and 12 year old daughters could be placed several buildings away. After much debate we settled for an alternative building for a few nights, and then one room upstairs, and another downstairs for the remainder. We were told the Leela did not have adjoining rooms (they do!). We were told that there was a 12 hole golf course complete with caddiesand buggies (its a pitch and put). We were told there was a private beach - it is for about 30 yards, but the beach is traded by hawkers who can be very persistent. Get the message - lots of false promises and accentuating the positive to the point of disbelief.

I was ill for about 3 days with food poisoning, and my wife for about 7 days. The riverside reasaurant was probably the culprit. The Indian resturant had a very limited menu but the quality was good. Drinks are 5 times the price of outside the hotel (thats what the * in 5* means - multiply!) The onsite cafe was good. The pool was relatively small. The Spa was quite good. Its a shame.",0
215,"I am fortunate to be an `old Leela hand', having stayed there for the past four or five years; which makes its current state even more painful. First, let me say that the Leela physcially remains one of the most beautiful beach resorts not only in India, but in the world. Its layout and landscaping are breathtaking. But today it is tired...it lacks its past spirit; the staff is disenchanted; the food is mediocre (even in its vast, apparently sumptuous-looking, buffets). Nobody, from the manager down, seems to care. If celebrities continue to come, i.e. Bill Clinton, etc., it is because there simply is no other hotel of this category in Goa. Some years ago, they added a `super deluxe Club' within the resort; and for astronomical rates, you get a huge air-conditioned villa whose permanently closed windows face a greenway; a vast bed overlooking a huge plasma TV and amenities that they have notably taken away from the rest of the hotel. The main hotel's pool is gorgeous, with a lovely waterfall: but, as was evident from guests' vigorous complaints, there is a woeful...and potentially hazardous...lack of chlorine. by the afternoon, when most of the guests were there. When guests complained...and this was at a holiday time when the pool was full of children...management simply shrugged its shoulders and declared that `this is not a high priority'! It is a special pity because the Leela in its better days was virtually unmatched anywhere in India. I eagerly await its return to glory!",0
216,I was trying to book our annual family(of 5) holiday to Goa. We stayed at Taj Exotica last year and wanted to try The Leela this year. I called them to find out more and unbelievably they do not provide their guests with free internet. Based on all the reviews it seems like a very nice hotel but unfortunately we will not get to try it first hand. In this day and age when even the smallest of guest houses have free internet - it is inexcusable to have your guests pay for internet. 'It is the hotel policy' is the terse reply I got when I called the reservation department.,0
217,"Worst experience ever . Will never ever stay here again even if offered free room . It was pure torture . Have been staying in Taj exotica for last 5 years , Leela is not even 10% of what Taj is . There were snakes in the pond / lagoon right next to the room and one they even caught in front of our room . Food and room was pretty good though . They have so many restrictions regarding every thing , its like staying in a jail not resort . They have 6 people staying right next to the pool just to implement the rules and not even one life guard for either of the pools . Ridiculously small swimming pool . Very unfriendly staff , no body greets you when even if they pass by you . No place for any games and badly maintained lawns . Taj exotica beats this property any given day and after experiencing Tajs hospitality , this under par experience is just not acceptable . Have pics of snake if any body wants to see :) . Lizard in bathroom .",0
218,"Nothing spells summer more profoundly than the beaches of Goa. And then you look for unmatched hospitality and are willing to pay the price. But what happens when a cheeky attitude gets the better of hospitality. Complete put off. Have been staying so regularly at the Leela's since 2002 and have never faced such bad service. I think after Capt Krishnan Nair they haven't been able to live up to its standard and they badly need to introspect. 
Where in the world do they charge you for wifi. They don't even have free wifi in the lobby. I guess they don't realise it's time to change and match up to international standards and not every time will they be able to getaway by landscaping. 
The guest services don't answer their phones. When they finally do it takes a very long time for them to attend to the issues. 
To begin with the bathroom was stinking. So much for being a Leela legacy where they charge you even for sneezing. They are running their hotel in a bookish military rule fashion where their only concern is to bring their failing legacy out of the immense loses and couldn't be bothered about the guests feelings.
I must mention at this point that their competitors Grand Hyatt in this way were superbly hospitable. They went all out to provide us with the minutest request and never wrongly charged us a dime.
Completely disappointed. Will never come back. They need to be more transparent by putting all extra charges openly online so the customer knows what they are paying for.",0
219,"From Check in to dining this was a complete disaster, I have stayed here before 2 years ago and it was fabulous with excellent attention to detail, this time it lacked it all, lots of staff but keep missing basics, for example rang reception for a plaster for my son ( who had cut himself ) and it wasn't delivered until I chased it up 45 minutes later. Check in was slow and the rooms were not organised, not something you expect from a hotel of this calibre. Location is excellent, however it seems like the basics are now missing. I have heard the Hotel has changed hands recently and this could be the reason why service levels have dropped so dramatically, however the price has increased with inflation.",0
220,"First visit to the leela was amazing so we went back only to be sorely disappointed. The whole welcoming vibe and warmth of the resort has gone and everything from the front desk service to the quality of food has dropped. I'd go as far in saying that the front desk manager (Ashley) and his team could benefit from a few weeks of hospitality training as they really are clueless on how to manage guests. 
The Leela is also the only 5 star hotel in India that charges for coconut water as part of the breakfast buffet. How they can justify this, I'm not sure. 

If you want true luxury and great service, avoid this hotel and try the Taj instead.",0
221,"For the week we spent in the South for New years we stayed at the Raddison Blu. In the North we visited the Taj Hotel for a day and loved it, so we decided to do the same at the Leela, as my brother and father wanted to use the golf course that wasn't available at our hotel (to which it cost them 50).On the phone beforehand we were told that we could use the beach facilities for 50 for four people. Thinking it was ridiculous to pay for beach chairs given that we were going to spend a lot of money later we settled for two chairs thinking they would charge us 25. As soon as we arrived on the beach they radioed all security, they said we were to pay 50 for two people despite making a deal over the phone. 

We couldn't relax on the beach as all eyes were on us and it made us feel like we were criminals because we were not residents at the hotel. On top of that there was a man serving watermelon to guests on the chairs, when he passed us he he blatantly avoided giving us some, though we were paying for it. I understand the Leela prides itself with high profile guests, but does it really have to be that high profile to treat normal visitors inhumanely? When my brother and father finished the game of golf security were waiting for them. In the end they kept to their deal and charged us 25 for the chairs. After they realised we were paying customers they changed their tune and treated us like royalty when we were dining at the beach restaurant- Little too late if you ask me. We ended up paying around 250 for dinner! The total for one day wasted of our holiday was over 300.

I understand the experience for residents of this hotel may be different. The grounds of the Leela is beautiful and no doubt the rooms must be exquisite, however the atmosphere was so quiet, dry and isolated. I reckon the Lalit and Taj would be equally as beautiful and the experience a whole lot better. Looking back we regret not staying at the Lalit, as it is very close to Palolem beach (The best in Goa). Also the Fisherman's Warf (A restaurant) in the same vicinity of the Leela was fantastic, half the price, better views and fun atmosphere.

In sum, my suggestion having visited Goa would be, if you want complete isolation and a pretentious atmosphere stay at the Leela. If you want fun and luxury go to the Lalit/ Taj. If you want a nice friendly place that isn't so expensive and family friendly go to the Holiday Inn/ Radisson Blu.",0
222,"The Leela Goa prides itself as being one the best hotels in Goa, which may be true for guests staying at the hotel. Clearly they don't give a damn about non residents wishing to dine in the restaurant. We made a reservation for the night of 1st January in the Riverside restaurant, the last night in Goa for 3 of our party. So sad to turn up to find no record of the reservation. It was suggested we wait in the bar until a table became available (a likely long wait). Other than that there was nothing else offered to help us although they did suggest dining in another restaurant.

Security at the hotel is robust. When making the reservation, in person, at the hotel reception, we were greeted at the gate by officers who ID. We were then greeted by more security at reception. Told to ensure we were wearing the proper attire on the night we felt assured all was in order and that all was being professionally run. It just goes to show that you are only as good as the staff you employ and the two individuals who made our reservation have let the hotel down.

We finally dined in the beach restaurant which was fine. The food was good and the staff great. The 20% discount was a nice gesture but the damage had been done. On a previous evening we had dined at the adjacent Fisherman Wharf restaurant, same setting, great food and atmosphere and much cheaper. If we come back to Goa, which is an almost certainty, the Leela will not be on the agenda.",0

The Leela was sold to us as an amazing place.
This hotel is aimed at the Indian market, is not western at all, which i found out.
The staff have not been trained very well if at all, as even when asked to get a plate of french fries was too difficult for them as did not understand english, something which happened for the whole of the week we were there.
The management where just the same, a simple order of chicken and chips was a major thing to order, was upsetting as all food was paid for and all we ate was chips chips chips, even asked for a chicken korma which arrived uncooked. Not impressed.
Came back home 2 stone lighter which was the only plus about this holiday.
If you hate mosies do not go there, we were feasted on every night to and from the restaurant, and we were covered/drowned in spray, and will have the scars to remind us of a nightmare holiday.",0
228,"I was staying close by the Leela and wanted to meet with friends staying at this resort. She put my name on a list at the reception and then called to tell me they wanted IR5000 for me to come inside and meet with them. I refused to pay as I pay that much for my beautiful apartment on the same beach, just 15 km away for a week!. My friend was on her honeymoon and begged me to come saying her new husband would pay for me to come in and greet them. I was allowed to stay on a sunbed for this price. I paid IR1000 for a small salad and a soda. I asked for a taxi to go back to my own lovely apartment and I said sorry and walked outside the resort and paid IR10 for a bus ride home...sorry this is overrated and the service sucked! I love my sweet apartment in Benaulim...same beach..same Sea.",0
229,"Stayed here from 25th April to 6th March.

Pros:-
Nice enough rooms
The beach is nice

Cons:-
Rooms more expensive than London for similar quality

Hotel takes a cut from anyone trading in the vicinity including shacks, watersports, taxis. This means all services around the hotel are 2x or more the price of elsewhere in Goa.

Staff service is the most terrible I have ever experienced, even a UK Travel Lodge is far superior. As an example and there are many, at breakfast it took 30 minutes for anyone to ask if we wanted tea or coffee, and even then took another 15+ minutes to arrive by which point my partner and I had all but finished breakfast; this happened every day we were there. On several occasions I had to remind staff to bring the tea/coffee and remind them we were there at all.

I also noticed several other guests becoming very annoyed at this lack of service.

Secondly at breakfast the hotel serves various branded yoghurts as part of the buffet. I approached the counter to pickup what were the last two yoghurts of the day and as I was no more than 2 meters away two hotel staff members snatched the yoghurts from infront of me and made haste in case their boss saw.

Thirdly the cocktails are awful. On three separate occasions I had to complain about Mojitos being mixed incorrectly, not enough mint or rum - there must be a mint and rum shortage in Goa right now. My partner noticed this lack of quality stems from the fact that most bar staff are not really bar staff and seemingly alternate between being barman and towel attendants. We noticed only two bar staff capable enough to taste the cocktails before serving to customers.

Fourthly, the general quality of food is terrible. This starts right from breakfast with supposed indian tea actually being Twinings tea bags that I could buy back home from Asda. Do not bother asking for Masala tea since they just use a black tea bag and shove milk and masala powder in the pot...yuck. Do not bother with room service of restaurants either as you will pay well over a 3 Michelin Star London restaurant prices for food that is worse than Nandos.


On one occasion my partner and I were going out and on a strict time table for the days activities, we only had time to have cereal for breakfast and asked the waiter to box up some pastries for us to take with us. This request was refused, I have never stayed in a hotel where this would ever be refused before, especially not a supposed 5* hotel. Their reason for this is because people would not buy the lunch buffet. Again another example of how they treat paying customers.


If you didn't get the drift now... basically do not stay here and if you do, do not eat here. Spend no money at this hotel, everything is an extra. If you stay here go and eat at Blue Whale Shack further south down the beach where you will find much better food at a fraction of the cost and will not have to deal with the snarling attitude of the Leela staff.

To top it all off on our checkout not one staff member asked us how our stay was and after paying the bill in cash the cashier pocketed the change as a tip and ran off.",0
230,"From the moment we checked in, the experience was downhill.The service is mediocre at best,the food almost tasteless, you can't change the temperature of the air conditioning in your room below 21 as it's centrally controlled...I could go on and on and it's only my first day here!Frankly can't wait to go home!",0
231,"We stayed in leela hotel goa - staff is not cooperative at all , we have to wait for fooding items , water, Even the spoons and forks are not there, tables r not clean after first attended guest it takes about 2 hrs to complete our fooding as might be hotel having less staff or might be they should be hired nicely , also statf is having attitude problems , cant even give cart lift for walking ladies & childerens when the cart is fully empty . There was DND Sign on door and the house keeping guy opened the door and entered , the intensions of hoteliers are malafied ,Also we have to wait for almost 20 min everytime after calling for pickup. We did not feel comfortable over there, and checked out 2 days earlier ..we complained to president of leela group after that whole hotel staff seemed to argue us and each and everyone is tried to prove us wrong at every point even after molesting our ladies intentionaly and giving us lame exuse of saying its our hotel policy that any body can enter in our room with masterkey even when our ladies are in bathroom and they are shouting pls wait pls wait but they will enter in your bathroom and on the top of that your general manager is arguing us this is our hotel policy . 
Your hotel policy is that if no body complains for anything than also your staff will enter in the room forcefully and your G. M will say its our policy that we can go to any room anytime for having fun with ladies guest .",0
232,"I was staying at The Leela during the last week of May and what a stay....my wallet goes missing from my room...is stolen and the attitude of the GM was utterly disappointing.....not even once did Mr.Nair meet me or speak to me or even write across....the wallet is still missing and the culprit is still hanging out there at the hotel....but the Hotel Management does not have the courage to admit that the culprit is one of their own employees.very disappointed not because my wallet was stolen.....but disappointed to see the ATTITUDE of the Management and this is is the Service Industry...the kind of stress I am going through.

Stayed May 2014, travelled on business",0
233,"It's a nice large campus. Clearly big and tiring to walk around. But for peak season - $450 a night + $250 a head forced dinners. It is way way overpriced for completely 3 star service. 


Clearly value equals a three star Taj hotel but priced like a Four Seasons, Which it is NOT.

Not a classy hotel: 


Eg 1 :
Xmas night - forced a $250 buffet dinner per head, With strangers. 
$250 per head excludes alcohol, clearly poor choice. 




Eg2:

Check- in took over 30 minutes . 

They did give me coconut water while i soaked my irritation. 


The staff never explained anything about anything. For a giant property where walking to the buffet is a 1 km walk. I think it's a resort for teenagers. 


Eg3:
duty managers are clueless. Which clearly is the case with most of the staff at Leela 

Leela has nice properties in general but consistently mediocre service. 

It's over priced for what it delivers. A lot more staff training and finishing needed. 

Eg4:
Pretend service desk: eg golf deal. If u go to the desk - The sign advertises ""hand reading and spa"". 

The guys will just sit and smile and not proactively answer anyway. It's a dog what you want out of me style. 

The training if the staff is horrible. Most guys barely speak English forget finishing. My Friends called the army soldiers (staff) bewildered untrained monxxxs
- ""whaaat do you want sir"" 

it's ""live and let die"", so not a super service by any standard. 

unfinished folks - if you want a four seasons service and great Indian hospitality , This Leela isn't it. 


Eg 5: 
Beach section chair resort: 
To get attention you have to put up red - blue flag apparently. 

But even they don't keep which flag does what - so with no instructions. No guest knows. Even If you put it up - 20 minutes to an attending coming was normal ! 

not classy for what You will pay at all",0
234,"Pool is very small & shallow, lot of mosquitos & bugs in the property, beware of bicycle which the property offer complementary for 30 mins they are not in good conditions, my wife injured her knee while riding one of this bicycle. 

When we check in the hotel we were asked to pay additional charges for one kids as the hotel policy didn't allow more than one child in the room, the villa balcony is converted in to child room therefore we lost the opportunity of enjoying siting in the balcony despite paying the additional charges the children has to suffer entire night as their room temperature was not ambient.

Shaving kit they offered in the washroom was of very cheap quality I had too many cuts after using their complementary shaving cut.

Hotel Staff is very unfriendly and seems this property is totally commercial.

Leela Goa is not value for the money you pay; I would strongly recommend Taj Exotica or Park Hyatt in Goa if you are planning a vacation with your family. 

Overall experience was Terrible !!!!!!!!!!",0
235,"The Property is too old The Staff too tired to help or smile..Don't go relying on the great pics...this property feels like a 30 year old property..only the landscaping gardens are well maintained..and the rooms..I beleive the ones renovated..otherwise the property cries out loud for renovation...Lobby is so dull and depressing...the much Hyped about ""RiverSide"" restaurant feels like you're in 70's..creeking chairs..somber mood...pathetic condition..I am surprised that this is the Famed Leela..! We had a 3 Year Old kid with us..and they have just a small room full with toys to play...its so small..?? Few Slides are there but out in the sun ?? The Spa is also as Terrible as other parts of the property..you donot feel rejuvenated at all. The In Room Dining lacks the Style and detailing you expect from a 5* or 7*...We reached our Villa around 3:40 PM and when I tried to order Pizza..they refused...saying Lunch hours close at 3:30...Terrible Start...Only Staff that are willing and smiling are the buggy drivers....I URGE ALL TRAVELLERS TO NOT TO GET LURED BY THE PICS OF THE PROPERTY ..or the Name ...",0
236,It took them 2 hours for check in of the room after we reached. We came at 3 pm and there check in time is 2 pm and none of them replied our question. Every time I asked they are like give us 5 minutes and we will revert back. Even the manager on duty called back when we requested the front desk. Really worst experience from such a hotel.,0
237,"Room was full of mosquitoes. There were at least 50 mosquitoes in room at any time. The moment you open the door, the next batch of mosquitoes was ready to enter room!

We felt sick due to continuous ""Hit"" spray. 
Horrible experience!!!!",0
238,"We stayed in a Royal Villa for four nights. Very fancy and not a cheap option for a family of 2 adults and 3 small children under 5. The room was fantastic. The butler was truly great at his job and we lacked for nothing. Our little private pool kept the children happy for hours. The whole hotel looks special and is a grand place to holiday.

This was spoiled by a feeling of being gouged. Everything cost extra. A bottle of water with breakfast. 1900 rupees for 3 disappointing sandwiches for the children on departure. Internet connectivity. The bad taste started at the beach restaurant where the fish we were served tasted 'mothy' at best. We were asked by a number of the staff whether we were enjoying our food. ""No"" was the measured answer. Nothing happened. Even after speaking to the baby-faced manager. The simple beach bar next door served perfect fresh fish for a fraction of the price.

I won't remember this holiday with especially fond memories.",0
239,"Had grouped to celebrate my sisters and brother-in-laws 10th anniversary, and everything went wrong. Food was disgraceful (burnt rice was served, bland soup, melted ice-cream served). Even after speaking to the manager on duty couple of time and having 3 times listen to meaningless apologies and promises there was not an iota of improvement rather as the evening progressed it rather deteriorated. 
I even left my e-mail and mobile number for the senior management to reach me, but till date the have disappointed me. For the management not to have an excuse how to reach me, please find my e-mail address to you can discuss this further.

240,"This hotel is not 5 * and it certainly is not a Kempinski. I have stayed at other Leela hotels and other Kempinski brands, and this by far is the worse. 
Food quality was poor, service was over the top, staff were arrogant and not very helpful. Hotel is very far from the main the capital city of Goa. Spa is very small, the treatment rooms are cramped. Considering the hotel is on 75 acres, the pool is so small, i've seen bigger pools in peoples back yards.Room service food was always cold. You know something is wrong when you have asked for tea three times, and each time it arrives it is stone cold! Had diahorrea after eating in their indian restaurant. Waited 15 to 20 minutes on most mornings for a table at breakfast as breakfast area is small and congested. There is no adult bar area to relax in the evenings,
GO STAY AT THE TAJ EXOTICA INSTEAD...!!!",0
241,"Thisn hotel is completely over hyped. We stayed there for a long and were completely underwhelmed.


Check in- We were checked into a room beside building work. I asked to move rooms and was treated as if I was asking for something ridiculous. One hour later we got a new room

- The room was in need of decoration, but was a good size and had a nice setting - no complaints there

Food- over priced and not good. Went to the Italian restaurant 
(several power cuts during meal) The cheapest bottle of imported wine
was over $200. The food - straight out of a Pizza Hut buffet.

Pool side bar- ordered drinks and had the usual appalling level of service that is so usual in India. I am not exaggerating, it took 45 minujtes to get the correct bill for the drinks.

Room service- dont bother - a few limp chips and an overcooked burger
$30.

$1200 for a three night stay- money down the drain. Definitely not worth the one hour drive from the airport

Liked  The room was pleasant
Disliked  Very poor service- more training needed",0
242,"the worst thing that happened in this 5 star hotel, Is that someone stole in our room. the staff didn't excuse with us nor felt ashamed for what happened. the only thing they did was make us belive it was a mistery! incredibile!
the worst treatment ever recieved in a hotel that wants to be a luxiours hotel but isn't. rooms nice but dirty, a lot of dust . bas experience.


Liked  nothing
Disliked  how the staff behaved with us",0
243,"Went to Goa for the first time & heard great reviews about the The Leela. Booked 2 rooms. As a property the Leela is amazing. Now thats the only good thing I can say about this hotel. The service, is terrible & the all inclusive meal is below standard.

Went to the private beach as they term it left my sandals under my parasol. Was away for 1/2 hr & on my return found my sandals were missing. The strange thing is that there is a security person overlooking the beach area. When I questioned him about the loss he was cluless. I reported my loss to the Hotel management who frankly didnt care a damn. 

The next evening went to the coffe shop at 11pm & asked to be served an ice cream & was told by the staff to go to the competitors hotel across the street. Very strange!

They operate a buggy system around the hotel suggest you dont call them becuase they never turn up. Its easier to walk.

Strongly suggest not to visit this hotel stay anywhere in Goa but the Leela",0
244,I booked a sea facing view room for my family this Valentine's Day and it was worth every penny..The property offers a breathtaking view of the pristine blue beaches of Goa..The rooms and the services are top notch and the personalized care is par excellence..A must for a Goan trip..,1
245,"One of the Best Property, well maintained.. Great ambience, food, amenities and specially the services. It was not our first trip to Goa but this one is the most amazing. The difference is our stay at Taj fort Aguada.. Staff is friendly and helpful. Superb hospitality... Beautiful ground floor sea view room with sit out.. Breakfast is fantastic, such choice and the smiling, pleasant staff are only too happy to get you anything you need, rare to see in other hotels, The spa is serene and simply delightful.
Was thinking for any faults or anything less at Hotel, but could not find any.. ",1
246,"stayed there in villa with private sit-out, situated over the small hill...excellent view from room and ample space in garden for kids to play...beach is just near to the property where all water sport activities are available..during weekend specially on Sunday restaurant is crowdy and you have to wait for table so you can better start early for breakfast...food quality is good but they have less options as compared to Taj exotica...as property is spread over the hill , you have less activities like cycling etc for kids.. even they dont have separate pool for kids..so if you are staying with kids may be Taj exotica is better option...overall great stay..",1
247,"We went to this place to celebrate my Wife's birthday. It was a great time with the family at Aguada. Great food and sea facing bar is the highlight. We were spending most of the time looking at the sea and chilling out. We were planning to roam around Goa, but finally ended up spending three full days in the hotel and the surrounding places :-)",1
248,I had stayed there only for a day but had an amazing experience. The staff was very friendly and courteous and they made our stay memorable. We would surely visit again and stay for a longer duration.,1
249,"I was there last year during July last week to celebrate our anniversary. The place is simply awesome, and they took extra care to prepare food for our 1.5 year kid. Although rain spoiled our stay (we could not go out much), the resource was awesome. would like to visit second time in a better season.",1
250,"We went with our 6 month old kid and it was a complete joy ride...did not even once felt like moving out of the property.
Very very relaxing and homely experience ...villas are a great stay !!!! Highly recommended!!",1
251,"It was a special trip for my husband and me and we were unsure how it would turn out. Taj properties are usually pretty, well maintained and staff is hospitable however, in this trip the staff did everything possible to delight us every single day. It was my birthday and surprises were planned with my husband throughout! The food is fantastic especially the Goan Thali (Chef Pandey). I would highly recommend this place and specially thank Jessly who went out of her way to make the stay memorable. Thank you.",1
252,"Went on trip with family and friends, after staying in holiday village a year before i was missing the quiet of Taj-Fort Aguada (was there in 2011). This place is one of the best property of Taj and view from cottages is mesmerizing. SFX lounge was the best part in last visit as we happened to spend a considerable amount of time lazying and drunk on awesome cocktails they come up with. Very friendly staff and great place to bring kids along.",1
253,"Taj Hospitality does not leave a chance for complaint.! Absolute cozy. Food, stay and service too good. My daughter, wife and I enjoyed it a lot. I took a Villa facing the sea face. The view was not that great, enjoyed the privacy. Great Stay.",1
254,very comfortable stay. away from the touristy crowd. We spent most of our time by the pool drinking and chilling and head out to the beach during the day. This hotel is a good for couples and families who want to relax and be away from the crowded.,1
255,"We had a wonderful stay at Vivanta by Taj Fort Aguada. It is a fantastic location to stay in North Goa. View from lobby was awesome. The best part about my stay was the service. They were friendly and efficient. Pool was good, however I found Pool at Holiday Village better. But best part is one can use both properties irrespective of stay hotel. Sinquerim Beach was serene.

Really a very memorable stay at the Taj and would like to visit again",1
256,"We visited Goa in December, this is a fantastic location for anyone who really wants to relax and have fun. The hotel is amazing, the restaurants in the Vivanta are incredible with an Italian food offering which is simply delicious. Vincent is the manager and he is truly a brilliant host as well as someone who genuinely cares about the experience. We met the chefs and the kindness shown by the team who work in the hotel is beyond gracious- they want you to have a great holiday and will try to make this happen. 
The restaurants-Latitude, the Banyan Tree- yes Thai in Goa and brilliant! and my favorite Il Camino. The bar in the hotel is also worth several trips when you go enjoy the sunset with my friend Ravi- the manager and Akshay who work there- they are so friendly and simply great at making you feel at home

If you like seafood visit Morisco- they have the best range and their Chefs are fabulous as well as hospitable",1
257,"Taj like always made us feel very special. The accommodation was excellent.The first thing that struck me was the refreshing ,restful perfume in the room. I wanted to ask them what it was but forgot.One felt refreshed straight away.The location is excellent...the spa was wonderful and I enjoyed the yoga .The instructor was very patient and gentle.The food was excellent. Will return definitely.",1
258,"I am so glad we picked the Taj for our stay in Goa. The fact that there were so many other families with young children was a good sign. That said there's a nice mix of guests from honeymooners to retired Europeans on vacation. 
Pros: you don't have to leave the property if you really don't want to. There is a great selection in their breakfast buffet. Right after breakfast my kids would head over to the activity center or pool that's adjacent to the restaurant and spend the whole morning there. The hotel provides pool toys and sand buckets for kids. The children's activity center is clean and you have to take off your shoes to enter. It has board games, puzzles, toys, stuffed animals, carom board, pool table and air hockey table. They offer hair braiding, henna and temporary tattoos as well as book mark decorating etc. I was excited to see that they had a small library with adult and children's books but found that the library was mainly filled with non-English European books. Probably filled with books left by previous guests. 
The access to the beach is guarded and you can grab some hotel towels at the entrance and leave your shoes up there before going down. It's a very clean beach and they make an effort to sweep up any trash first thing in the morning that got swept up with the high tide. There are 2 restaurants on the beach and I highly recommend the Fish Shack, especially the Goan fried masala fish and spicy garlic prawns. The daal tarka was also a hit. They offer pasta and fries for kids too. One bonus about this place: its floor is basically the sand on the beach so the kids can play with buckets provided by the restaurant and stay busy right next to your table while you eat, in the shade. We loved the food so much that we went there for lunch and dinner on the same day. 
Water activities can also be scheduled at the beach itself. 
There are benches and day beds on the hotel property overlooking the beach. Go there in the evenings and take in the sunset while enjoying the cool breeze. I'd order tea and relax out there. 
The hotel grounds are well kept and it was nice being able to let the kids run around freely around the coconut trees to burn off some energy. Staff are all helpful and friendly with kids.
On one of the days I took my mother in law and mom and headed to the 7sea's spa across the Taj entrance and we enjoyed massages there. 
There are some souvenir shops and restaurants along the street. We ran out of diapers and I was able to buy some at a chemist about a 5 minute walk away. The souvenir shops were ok, but if you need extra t shorts or flip flops/ swim
suits then they are available. 
Con: don't stay in the block of the hotel with room 1017. It's next to a private residence with multiple dogs and I was woken up by incessant barking in the morning. Not good when you're trying to sleep in on your vacation. They didn't have any coils or plug-ins for mosquitoes in the rooms so make sure you carry repellent as there are mosquitos. My in laws had a cottage and the rest of the party stayed in rooms on the 2nd floor. I recommend the cottages because of the verandah and garden space you have. The gardens also have hammocks. 
Wi-fi sucks and would get disconnected constantly but if you're on vacation maybe you should be off-line anyways. Just made it hard to stream videos for the kids on the phone when we needed to keep them busy. 
We stayed for 3 nights and then took the free shuttle provided by the hotel back to the airport. Very convenient. ",1
259,"Loved our holiday here, beautiful hotel and rooms (lots of rooms don't have a balcony) and the best view in the area. All rooms have a beautiful sea view and the hotel is right on the beach. Great service and lovely breakfast with a good selection of Indian and European food. At the quiet end of the beach, which means you have a short walk to bars and restaurants but plenty of taxis outside the hotel. Would love to return!",1
260,Great views near sea I had a great time this place is totally amazing and the weather was killing I just loved the place and people of goa I will defiantly cone again and again whenever I'll be free my wife will be very happy to explore goa,1
261,"Our first stay, and just wished we had stayed before,lives up to its 5 star rating, sea view room , very good , garden and pool areas, excellent, well kept, very high standards, some good touches,fruit in the rooms, flowers, and provided cold bottles water,by the pool,breakfast superb buffet style, all the staff from cleaners,pool lads,reception, very efficient, only negative was our room had an adjoining door ,which you could hear everything going on ,to the next room, not happy about that otherwise fantastic stay",1
262,"Our first visit to Goa and to the Vivanta by Taj hotel. We arrived before 8am after a long flight, on my birthday. We received a very friendly welcome at reception. Our room was ready, and held a huge surprise of balloons, cake, fruit and wine. Our room was on the ground floor with a fabulous sea view. We were rather disappointed that our picture window didn't open but considering the mosquito situation, maybe not a bad thing. The air con is very efficient, sometimes too cold, but easily adjusted. The bed was huge with two types of pillows and a light weight quilt. The room held two easy chairs, great for enjoying the view, cool tiled floors, a generous sized fridge, and excellent easy to use safe. The bathroom was quite dated, but had a great over the bath shower, which seemed quite new, but maybe some upgrading in the bathrooms is needed. Plenty of toiletries available and lots of good towels, robes and slippers. The hotel has a fabulous reception area with elegant sofas and chairs and large open aspect for admiring the scenery. Our room was kept immaculately by our room boy and our bed turned down in the evening. The dining room is spacious with lots of comfortable seating, also outdoor seating which is rather limited, but not a hardship to eat inside. The breakfasts were incredible with an amazing choice of delicious foods. We only dined in on one occasion in the evening as there are so many amazing restaurants outside of the hotel, but the hotel stage dining experience evenings a couple of times a week which look quite spectacular but are quite expensive. The pool and surrounding areas are very good, maybe the crazy paving could be tidied up, as the sun loungers stir up the soil underneath which is not so good when emerging from the pool with wet feet. Plenty of sun loungers and also large canopy beds are available. The beach is accessible down a few steps, but due to tight security you will have to be let in and out of a locked gate. The pool guys are so friendly and obliging, and will always make your favourite beds available when possible. Christmas decorations here weren't rolled out until about 10 days before Christmas, and even then it gradually appeared and was tasteful, and elegant. Perhaps the Christmas music was rather too loud at times but so much nicer than the UK ear bashing from Sept thro to Dec 25th!! We were invited to the Christmas Eve gala at the venue above the hotel, which was a fabulous and indulgent evening involving the most delicious food, wine, music and company. The venue was decorated so dramatically it really took your breath away, from the table decor to the stunning draped swags to the fantastic stage. The food choice was endless, and the serving dishes (manned by numerous chefs) held all manor of world cuisine. The desserts were out of this world and a feast for the eyes. The head chef has an amazing team, who obviously excel at a very high level of catering. We spent the the best evening anywhere we've had in a long time. The dining room waiters were on hand for your every whim and they all work (and worked on the evening) so hard. Most of these guys would've been on shift from 6am until well after midnight and up again for breakfast the next morning, still with their warm smiles and friendly persona. I really can't speak highly enough about them. I could enthuse about this hotel for ever and a day, it really is a marvellous place for a holiday. A note to Ravi (general manager), to extend an enormous thankyou for our fabulous stay during and over the Christmas period. My husband and I can't applaud you enough for the way your hotel is operated. Your whole team, extending down from, managerial to waiting staff, to, catering to pool staff to cleaners, gardeners, maintenance are all outstanding, you should be extremely proud. Our two breakfast waiters, Jiben and Rajender were so very professional and nothing was ever too much trouble, please extend our sincere thanks. Our first trip to the Vivanta Fort Aguada but it won't be out last.",1
263,"This place is magic.
Great Ambiance.
Decent Meal. Did not burn a hole in our pocket(we were cautious of what we ordered as we don't waste food)
Highlight: the lounge has a beautiful view of the sea. i would just not feel like getting away.
The washroom at the restaurant has a shower to wash off sand if you directly come from the beach.
The service was TAJ standard. Live music was in English. Goan or Hindi would have felt better.
Do visit once for the experience of it. 
We tried: mushroon xacuti. Soup and roti. 5/5
we got papad complimentary. I like free stuff, so enjoyed it :)",1
264,"We had amazing experience with ambiance, food, amenities and specially the services. We went with our baby, and we're very impressed with hospitality of Miss Minky Sherpa, who gave us one of the amazing stay time in the hotel.
Definitely recommended.",1
265,"I visited this place with my husband and a couple of friends and I must say that it was a lovely experience. First of all, the location of the hotel is just ideal. The first two evenings we thought of going out to check out popular places around town to see the sundown, but we realised that this very hotel has one of the best sundown lounges in the city. The evening we spent at SFX lounge and bar will go down in memory as one of the best evenings we spent on the vacation. 

Another amazing thing about the hotel is its food. Whether it was indian or continental, the food can be described in one word - phenomenal. At the Italian restaurant at the hotel, the moment you bite into a pizza, you will be transported to a piazza in Rome or Florence. 

And last but not the least, the service and the staff of the hotel! They were not only responsive and co-operative but also proactive. Special mention to Minky who went the extra mile to make our baby moon all the more special. 

All in all, thank you Taj Vivanta for making our vacation unforgettable! We look forward to coming back soon.

266,It was not m first trip to Goa but this one is the most amazing. The diiference is my stay at Taj fort Aguada. Simply stunning location and view. Rooms are not that great as its an old property but yes well maintained. Staff is friendly and helpful and this you expects from Taj. Wonderful hospitality. Front office manager Dirgha is really helpful lady. I was provided an upgared as requested. Although I too has upgared voucher with me. Food is delicious. Huge property hence deserves a day to be spent in the resort itself.,1
267,"Words can't describe the experience.Surprisingly everything you need or wished on a holiday is available.Absolutely zero faults.

1.Hospitality - You can never see the whole staff in any hotel consistently reaching the high level of customer satisfaction as you do in Taj Aguada.It's because they have a great leader and example in Mr Ravi,General Manager

2.Breathtaking location and views


3.Fab food in the latitude restaurant

4.Plenty of great shacks on the beach to spend time with your loved ones

5.Very clean and spacious luxurious cottages with home theatre speakers in the room and DVD collections

6.Wi-Fi is an issue for people who do not have data in mobiles.But as Mr Obama said,wifi is even very bad in the White House.",1
268,"After a stressful journey (thanks Thomas Cook!!) we arrived to the stunning setting and delightful service provided by the Taj. The hotel was better than we had anticipated or than the photos show.

Beautiful ground floor sea view room with sit out, only minor comment would be the bathroom was a little 'tired' but I believe these are in the process of being refurbished. The hotel was truly delightful and the perfect oasis from the hubbub of the local surroundings. 

Breakfast is fantastic, such choice and the smiling, pleasant staff are only too happy to get you anything you need.

In fact all of the staff were delightful but special mentions for Jessyl who made us feel like we were the most important guests in the hotel, and who helped my birthday particularly special and Sanjeev at the pool.

I took advantage of a couple of treatments at the spa - a scrub and wrap to start the holiday and a facial at the end to relax me for the trip home. The spa is serene and simply delightful.

Couldn't fault the Taj, this was our first time but we will certainly be returning.",1
269,"Visited the Taj Aguada property on Jan 21st 2017 and was staying in room number 222. 

Typically Taj, the rooms were spotless and clean. Gorgeous view from the window of the rear side of the property and the beach. A sure place to visit for those who want a quick recharge from the chaotic city life. 

Room service is a bit slow. But the food is super. Worth the wait! 

I'd happy recommend this property to friends and loved ones to visit.",1
270,"""Thank you for such Tranquility and Rejuvenation! What a Vibe and Time we had. The moment we landed Goa, you made sure the Chauffeur was waiting for us. A lovely time spent here. Kudos to the entire Team.??",1
271,A well maintained property by Taj offering amazing sea view rooms and beautifully landscaped gardens. The rooms are spacious plus you get a small private patio with sea view rooms. A rampart from the hotel runs straight into the sea and one can spend evenings soaking up the sun and the sea. Food and service are equally good with big buffet spread. A costly but romantic place for couples.The only problem was the terrible wifi connectivity.,1
272,Just go sit back relax..enjoy..after all it's Taj hospitality..way to go guys..amazing property..amazing location..just the best you can say..we truly loved the view from the top..the food is amazing..and the four nights..that we spent are unforgettable..thanks again..keep going guys..!!,1
273,"Great hotel on the fantastic Candolim Beach - the ramparts form part of the hotel. The Sea view rooms have a small patio which lead into the hotel's gardens - the rooms are very well appointed with a very large bed, 2 armchairs, desk etc. The bathrooms are a bit tired but...!! The wifi can be a little tricky as well - keeps knocking you off the signal, so you have to re-log in.

Its a great place and I would definitely stay here again - expensive but worth it",1
274,"pros

no beach a bummer!
expensive spa next door. 
nothing much to complain its Goa you just relax and sip a chilled beer !!!!",1
275,"Staff at this hotel made the stay even more enjoyable with there efficient polite friendly service . Even assisted us with taking our little 9 month old baby boy to the main Children's hospital a hour away for a check up . The location is wonderful with a fantastic sunset and the local village a short walking distance away. 
The facilitts at the hotel very well worth booking. Mainly only eat breakfast at the hotel which was 5 star and dinned out on a evening . Well done to the whole team at the hotel great place .",1
276,"Visited this hotel in 2011. The service is exeptional. And the view of the ramparts of the old fort from the rooms are fascinating. Buffets are sumptuous and the staff will go out of their way to be helpful. Although you have beach access, the beach is not a private beach. The speciality restaurant Morisco serves fantastic sea food. Good value for money",1
277,"Great experience with family
Great view and delicious food
One of the best hotels in north goa
Next to beach and in fort aguada
Its rooms were very spacious and luxury cottages were the best
Overall an awesome experience",1
278,I stayed in dis hotel with my wife... Amazing hotel.. Amazing view.. Great view from the hotel.. One of the best place to stay in candolim.. Best part of the hotel is courtesy of their staff.. Always wearing a smile.. Make u feel special all d tym.. Hope to visit d place sooner,1
279,"I stayed in Dec 2016 for one night, property is vey big and nicely built. Rooms are big with all facilities and comfort. Food is excellent as in all taj properties. Don't have private beach but one can go to beach of adjacent another taj property.",1
280,"I'm a big fan of Taj service, and I've become a bigger fan after staying at this place. They are best in the class and you almost feel pampered after staying at Taj. 

It's a beautiful property, with all the rooms facing the sea. They have old and the new rooms, however I would suggest that you stay at the old wing as its closer to the sea so offers better view. I need not mention that the amenities are best in class and smallest of the things are taken care of in the room and hotel. 

I also loved the coffee shop as it overlooks the sea - so enjoy your breakfast or lunch with a nice sea view. 

All in all a must stay if you are looking for a luxurious stay in Goa.",1
281,"One of the best properties. Very beautiful very clean. On the beach. Immaculate views. Nothing that I can say was not up to the mark. You can just say wowwwww.
Customer service awesome...
Shuttle Awesome 
Food Awesome.
Updated rooms
Go for it....",1
282,"Stayed for 2 days at this amazingly beautiful property of the Taj Group.The location is just next to the beach with very spacious rooms,the food at the hotel is top class and so is the service.Would like to make a special mention of Ms Minky at the front desk who was ever so helpful with a beautiful smile that made us feel at home all the time.For a relaxed holiday in Goa this a place to be in.",1
283,"The Taj is perfectly located with beautiful panoramic views over Sinquerim beach.

The food was tasty & flavourful. Staff were attentive but not overbearing. Price reasonable in relation to the whole 'experience'.

Highly recommended",1
284,"What a lovely hotel with fabulous service. The pool men are friendly and helpful. There is always a sunbed available but it is a stones throw from the beach. Breakfasts are huge and have everything on offer. Food is divine but some is expensive compared to eating out.
The staff go out their way to help you in every way which is great.",1
285,"I stayed in the month of December. The initial view when you come in is absolutely stunning. From the service to the pool area, to the bar facing the sea this is a place worth paying for. The beach is easily accessible and the hotel is centrally located. The breakfast buffet is really good with a lot of selections. A lot of good restaurants near by also like fishermans wharf.",1
286,"We arrived earlier and were able to accommodate two hours earlier than the official checkin time.

The staff was always responsive and pleasant.

We had breakfast included and it was awesome, both vegetarian and non-vegeterian foods, fresh juices, authentic Indian food (yet it is often very spicy but we get apt to it and then loved it more than non-spicy).

We had a room with sea view and were delighted every morning when we watched out of the window.",1
287,We absolutely love this property and have made a habit of visiting them during the Christmas break each year. As it is a pet friendly resort we brought our Labrador along with us. We also participated in the rock climbing organised by the hotel and loved it. We will be back for sure.,1
288,One of the best hotels in North Goa. The Taj hospitality is always excellent. Good beach attached to it - although it was crowded this time of the year. The location of the hotel is next to the good restaurants of North Goa. Everything is in 30 minutes radius. The traffic in north Goa was quite a bit due to the holiday season.,1
289,"the property is amazingly located on the beach and just in front of the fort. You have a direct access to the beach as well as the fort. ample greenery fantastic rooms and awesome food.
a big thumbs up !!!!
highly recommended",1
290,"This was long overdue. I had a pleasure of staying at Taj Aquaford in Month of Oct with family. From the moment we walked through the doors we were charmed and thrilled! The Hotel location is outstanding and could not be beaten. Our first room wasn't best suited for our needs. Management was notified and Mr Nischal and His colleague Dirgha immediately fixed the problem. We were moved to another room and in fact upgraded with no expense to us. This immediately made our trip a pleasant one. Driver Mohan, was excellent in helping with directions and even took time to find schedules for us and have them ready for the next day. He took additional pain of cleaning our car each day and did not accept tips even when we offered. We returned as a Huge Fan of Mr Nischal and Team's Hospitality and Aquaford is definitely our default destination now whenever we return to Goa next. We will highly recommend Taj Aquaford to any of our friends and family who wish to travel to Goa.",1
291,"Have stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate my marriage anniversary and it turned out to be a great experience. Every thing is so perfect about this property- location, rooms, food , staff, services, hospitality... everything is TOP CLASS! Would highly recommend travellers visiting Goa to try this property! This place is perfect for for any occasion! I will definitely come back soon ... Keep up the good work team Taj - Fort Aguada. Cheers!!",1
292,"I would like to thank the general manager Mr. Nischal and Mandira for the amazing hospitality provided to us during our stay. Everything was looked after and surely made the holiday a memory to live for. The cottages were brilliant, excellent breakfast and the other food we had. Strongly recommend this property to anyone who plans to visit goa. Dont think twice and just go for it. The best in goa for sure",1
293,"Taj resort at Fort Aguada are true to its brand with 5 star guest care and attention to minutest details. I had requested room decoration & cake for anniversary celebrations which was done perfectly. Although, location is excellent, the rooms are bit dated here. You can also visit Taj Holiday village for breakfast and pool.
Lighting in room is really low.
Only thing which I disliked was they have airport transfers by bus. No transfers for railway station.
Enjoyed variety at breakfast buffet, evening folk dance, live music
Ambience- great
Food- great
Rooms-OK
Location - excellent",1
294,"The check in was quick, staff were polite. The hotels location is the best part, its just besides Fort Aguada and beautiful. one can walk down to the beach from there private gate. Room was spacious enough, and well decorated with attractive paintings. We had buffet lunch in one of there restaurants, with was really good.",1
295,"This was my 3rd stay at this property in the last two years. And as always it was a fantastic one.

We stayed in their villa rooms which were spacious, cosy and with an elegant old world charm.

We tried all their restaurants and food was delicious.

Kids were taken care and given extra attention by all the staff.

Hat's off to the Taj Way of Hospitality..!",1
296,"I stayed at the hotel for a couple of nights at the end of June. 

It's a great place to be during the monsoon. Wild torrential rain and great views over the ocean. 

I stayed in a cheaper room - about $250/night plus taxes. The rooms and facilities are ok. But the staff are excellent and go out of their way to offer great friendly service. I hope they get good bonuses. 

Goa itself has a mystique in the West it probably doesn't deserve any more. I feel sorry for the people - it looks like their politicians and developers are failing them badly. 

Lots of bad cheap development along the coast and inland and environmental destruction is becoming total. Garbage everywhere. I wouldn't swim in the water at the beaches. It all looked very polluted. 

In this mess the hotel offers a clean and comfortable oasis. I'd recommend it.",1
297,"Comfortable stay with some amazing views. The best feature of the hotel are the views & the Spa. Jiva has some of the best spa treatments and masseuse . Open only to the I house guests ( I believe) , it's the perfect way to begin a day or end a day! 
Recommended .",1
298,"We booked sea facing room which they upgraded to sea facing with sit out which we really liked it. Although room size was very compact but the best part was sit out area from where we can direct access to lawn and can enjoy the sea view. 
Check-in & Check-out was very smooth and the staff was very courteous and always welcomed us. 
We were very much satisfied with room dining services, very tasty food. Even the breakfast spread in Latitude restaurant was very nice. 
They have free shuttle to airport at different times during day which is very good and one can opt the services according to their flight time. 
Hotel is having various location where one can enjoy beautiful view of Sinquerium beach also having direct access to Fort Aguada.
The thing which I don,t like so much was room size. 
If you are looking for relaxing holiday and want to spend time in lap of nature then this is ideal place as sound of waves, greenery and cool wind can catch anyone attention.
Really want to go in near future.",1
299,"This hotel is the best place in Goa to stay and unwind yourselves, the hammocks just outside the rooms have great view of the sea & with light breeze is the best place in the whole property to spend time with your better half. 

Pros:
a) The location of the hotel is awesome.
b) The rooms have the best view of the ocean (Rooms in above floors have better view of ocean than the one`s I stayed in (see photos), but the ground floor rooms have direct access to the hammocks anytime, without having to go too much far from your rooms)
c) The pool though small is good.
d) You are greeted with warm smiles from the staff all the time.

Cons:
a) The bath tub is very small and easily overflows when u just want to soak in warm water with your better half.
b) The hair dryer was overheating and wasn`t working properly (so pls carry your hair dryers)
c) They generally prepare very bland food, so if you want anything spicy, please please inform them in advance.",1
300,"e did an extended family vist this time - parents, brother's family and us. It is a great property right on the sea. It was monsoon time, so the sight and sound of waves lashing on the walls of Fort Aguada was truly mesmerising. There were 3 children, and our elderly parents, in the group and the staff made sure that everyone felt comfy. The property is in North Goa, where all the action is, so one has the option of staying put in the property or venturing to some great eateries nearby. The only letdown was misleading package - we had booked 2 rooms with sit-outs and one without, hoping to enjoy the monsoons from the comfort of the room. However, the sit-outs dont have a roof, so that was quite a waste - unlike Taj Exotica. What was worse, the room without sit-out had the best view since that was on first-floor. We felt cheated since we had paid extra for rooms that were actually worse. We gave this feedback to the staff but have not seen any corrective action till date.",1
301,"This a beautiful property with sprawling area. The hotel is beautifully located on the beach front with access to the beach. Environmentally it is beautiful. Lots of greenery and well landscaped. They have a variety of rooms from independent villas to normal rooms. The independent villas are a treat and you can spoil yourself by staying in one such villa. The hotel service is good and the staff is very friendly, courteous and very helpful. They would go out of their way to help and assist. The hotel has a beautiful Spa and the restaurants are good. The food served is nice and tasteful. You can enjoy a good breakfast in the coffee shop. Wifi is free and you can enjoy the internet without having to pay anything. There is nice swimming pool and bar. Overall we had a very good experience and we really enjoyed ourselves. It is up to you how you look at it. Go and stay there and try it for yourself.",1
302,"Our choice of this property was based on a recommendation from friends. We traveled with 2 kids and chose an option that provided 3 meals during the day. The location was fabulous as was the view from a seaside-view room. The lawns were manicured and the greenery was spectacular during the rains. The food was excellent, including the places that served buffets. We had two-way airport drop. Although we traveled in a shared shuttle, the ride was smooth and comfortable. The hotel also provides a very efficient shuttle service to and from the Taj Holiday Village. Otherwise, it is a 15-minute walk from one hotel to the other. Thanks to Vincent, Sudipto, Ranjeet, Hemraj, staff at the Banyan Tree, El Camino, Beach House, staff at Giggles who made the experience special through their kind gestures. However the service at Caravela was a bit disappointing due to seemingly uncaring attention during breakfast and lunch hours a few times. We had to ask several times to be served the bread (while it had already been prepared and was in waiting near the oven), tea/coffee servings, etc. There were a couple of things that need some improvement. Firstly, the infrastructure seems to be lacking care at a few places. Some parts of the wall in our room showed signs of dampness, there was a faint smell of cigarette smoke in the bathroom during certain times of the day, the bathroom had a slight crack in the sink and a portion of the plaster from the toilet cover was chipped off. Overall, the bathroom seems to be old (perhaps due to the stained fittings) and could do with a face-lift. Given the size of the hotel, the pool is quite small. If 12-15 people get in at the same time, there will be limited space to move about freely. One thing that the hotel can do to improve attractiveness for kids and adults alike is to introduce a ""lazy river"".",1
303,"I have visited Vivanta by Taj 2 times.First in June 2015 and 2nd in June 2016.
This place has been improved. Management takes each single complaint seriously and this is the thing which I really appreciate.

No one is perfect but desire to maintain the class is what matters at last.
I really admire their breakfast and service. No need to visit any where . Just book a sea side room and get up early in morning to have a walk near fort .

After 5.30 PM just try to go out gate of Taj at left corner. Sit calmly and enjoy natural music of Sea. This is one of the most beautiful place I keep in my mind.

Ofcourse , will see you soon :)",1
304,"This resort is indeed the most luxurious in all of Goa. Set on a cliff near Sinquerim Beach, it is everything like the perfect holiday. Book this in advance as the availability might be tight. Full value for money I would say.",1
305,"I was planning a last minute surprise birthday dinner for my girlfriend in September, and i didn't know where to take her, so I decided to take her to Taj since she's never been there(and also cause she loves Italian and Taj has an Italian restaurant named, ""Il Camino"" ...Since I've worked there before and been to the property a few times later, it seemed like the ideal place that I could take my girlfriend to.

I called up the hotel, the same evening on her bday, and asked if I needed to reserve a table at Il Camino, but they said that the restaurant was closed for a private dinner. Damn was I disappointed! But, nevertheless, the restaurant staff said that he could reserve a table for me in their other restaurant, ""Latitude"". So I asked him if they could serve anything Italian and also make some bday arrangements, and he kindly replied that it was too late for any arrangements, but he would do his best to see what he could offer me. 

Later when we reached the hotel, the security staff greeted us warmly and we headed to the restaurant. We reached the restaurant pretty late and all the in-house guests were almost done with their dinner. There was a one-man-band guy singing amazing songs which lifted the ambience. We were offered a table and the menus were given to us(there was no bday arrangements made)...and I couldn't find much choice for Italian either, ... So we ordered what we thought would be nice... When the dishes came and we tasted em, boy were we pleased.... The pasta that my girlfriend ordered was amazingly delicious and she loved it. The restaurant staff were very helpful and kept asking us if they could get us anything else and even agreed to take a few pictures for us. After we were done, they even served us complimentary desserts! (Who doesn't love complimentary stuff ) and then out of nowhere came a small chocolate cake with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate! That was truly the highlight of the night and it made the dinner so very special for my girlfriend!

I thank the restaurant staff for being so courteous and making last minute arrangements, (even though I would've wished for more Italian and other bday arrangements ) this dinner, truly won't be forgotten by me and especially by my girlfriend. ",1
306,"The service was excellent. Every request was addressed efficiently. We were pleasantly surprised with balloons in the room when we returned from the beach. Rom service was always very prompt and they kept us informed if there was any confusion. Shuttle drivers were very polite and accommodating. The gate security was also very helpful. They cleaned our car without being asked.
Property is very well maintained. I could sense the attention to deal all around. We walked around and could see a number of new villas being added.
There is enough to do in and around the property for a long weekend type of visit. The beach is right outside and you can get to a quiet spot with a short walk. So we didn't try to do any additional beaches. 
There is a nice live music place called cohiba which you can go for using the complementary shuttle. Book in advance to get a good spot.
There is renovation underway in the lobby area. So the construction noise does carry over to the pool area. They did tell us about it before we arrived though i don't remember seeing it on the website at the time of booking. But it was no big deal. It is expected to be over next month November 2016.
Highly recommended getaway!",1
307,"Many beach resorts in Goa but not all have beach view from the window of your room. Truly amazing experience to wake up to the sound of waves n amazing view of sunset right from your balcony. The property is quite old but still has its charm very much intact and as usual hospitality at its best as usual. Food variety and quality was best. 

I am giving a 4/5 only because I felt the bathrooms were too small(and old) and we were in a allure suite and with 2 kids it wasn't very comfortable.",1
308,"We stayed in this resort for 3N/4D and had a good experience which would had been a little more pleasant if the hotel staff would had a gone a step ahead.

This is a huge property on Fort Aguada and is sea facing. Mostly the rooms are all sea facing. The beach is easily accessible through a special gate they have put near pool area.

We had booked Superior Charm room with breakfast and the room was on the ground floor with a back door opening to lawn area and facing sea. The pool area as well as beach could be easily seen from the room. 

Superior Charm room was beautifully done with a king size bed, two chairs and a small coffee table. The size of the room is average and not very big. Washroom was clean and nice but didn't had a bath tub.

Room service we experienced was prompt and the staff was also very polite and nice.

They also had DVD player with a list of Hindi and English movies which can be ordered free of cost.

We really liked the service for baby food which was very quick. The food was also as per baby liking. The chef's are very nice and consider the need of guests
Special thanks to Chef Ghanshyam.
They charged us only once for the baby food.

As far as food was concerned we had our dinner at Latitude where the cost was approximately 1800 with taxes and had a reasonable spread
The best part was the live music was there. There were other two restaurants with Goan good speciality and Italian restaurant. 

We liked their facility where in we were allowed to go to Taj holiday village and enjoy our meals. Even that property is one of its kinds. The shuttle facility is available all the time.

We also got many cabs available just outside resort which took us around the beaches.

Overall it's a beautiful resort as the view is breathtaking. The staff is courteous.Check in and check out was smooth.

The only thing we did not like was while we checked in the front desk staff was were cold and since we had a booking from Goibibo, that was something that bothered them.",1
309,"I have always been a religiously staying at Taj Village everytime i am in Goa. This time, it being a last minute plan, we chose Taj Aguada. I must say the villas are nice and spacious. The bathrooms were clean. Although there was some dust on the antique wall hanging with glass jewels. Post renovation, the place looks really better. Although they can do something about the noise from utility plant right next to Villa 427. We asked them to shift and they promptly did which was helpful.
We ordered Peri peri Fish and Rachedo Fish, lets say they were not the best in Goa, hence they can do better (Fisherman's Cove is better for food). The staff were v helpful. The buffet spread was decent. 
The airport pick and drop is very convenient.",1
310,"A solid place to stay with very good service and restaurants. The views are spectacular but it's a very busy location with lots of tourists walking around right outside the property. The public beach beside the hotel was extremely congested and dirty. Granted, we did go during a long weekend. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the sea which was really nice but the interior was starting to feel dated.",1
311,"The staff at the hotel were fantastic and we had a very nice welcome to the hotel. The sea view room that we had was lovely, and the pool area was well laid out. It didn't quite reach the full 5 marks because some elements of the hotel seemed a little worn and in need of an update. I appreciate we visited during the building work so perhaps once it is complete it'll be perfect. 
Well worth a visit if you are in the area for a longer stay.",1
312,"Lovely view of Fort Aguada remains, can walk straight to the famed structure through a private gate open only for residents. 
Excellent breakfast and also a choice to have breakfast at the nearby Taj Holiday Village. That gives a lot of variety....2 restaurants with totally different themes. Good activities for kids too. 
Was there in July and there isn't much one can do in Goa when it rains. So remain indoors and enjoy what the Taj has to offer!",1
313,"I checked in to this hotel in the month of January with my friends, I booked three months prior so, I striked a better deal, the hotel is really awesome, it is located near the famous landmark aguda fort, the proximity of the hotel is really good, the rooms are soo large, the beds are soo comfortable, the bathroom fittings are really excellent, the wifi connection is extremely speed..the staffs were soo feiensly overall we had a wonderful stay here...!!!",1
314,"Great property and amazingly courteous staff. The rooms feel a bit dated, however the scenic view makes up for it. Location is prime - very near to the most happening spots of Goa. Food at the restaurant is exceedingly good. Must stay once if you frequently holiday in Goa",1
315,"I stayed for three nights in the hotel during my official trip to Goa in Mid November. Booking was through my office international travel desk. 

I had opted for a paid airport pickup by Cab instead of availing the free shuttle. The car reported on time and journey to the hotel was uneventful. Check-in was smooth and I was allotted one of the cottages up the hill overlooking the fort and the beach. Amazing views from the sit out area of the cottage early in the morning while sipping my coffee.

Food was good as usual like in any Taj property and breakfast buffet was pretty good with a nice spread. Folks in all the restaurants were efficient and service was good. 

The room was a cottage which was spacious with all amenities including WiFi, Coffee Tray and Mini Bar provided for. House keeping was efficient. 

I had a bad experience during check out which I have high lighted as part of my feedback to the hotel a week ago. Strange that there has been no follow up from the hotel though I am an Inner Circle member and the feedback was pretty serious. I shall wait for them to respond to my feedback and provide an update on that depending on the follow up. 

Overall a nice getaway and I shall return again with family if my concern highlighted in formal feedback is noted",1
316,We stayed here for 5 days and enjoyed it very much.Overlooking the beach and close to it's sister hotel Taj village this was a relaxing break.The rooms were spread out and the entrance had palm trees that were beautifully lit with loads of lights.Not sure if the lights are there all the time or just around Diwali time.You could eat at the Taj village and vice Verda.The pool was big and well maintained.We had an evening meal by the pool area which was a set price buffet serving an assortment of dishes and had wine included.This hotel is on the expensive side but well worth it.,1
317,"I stayed here a few years ago with my family. The rooms are luxury and it is a nice get a away if you do not want to experience the rest of Goa. Although over-priced, they do offer a nice view of the Fort and sunsets.",1
318,"We stayed here on our annual summer vacation to Goa. This was our 1st visit to this hotel and we weren't disappointed. 

Being a foodie, we absolutely enjoyed the Goan cuisine served in the room. The checkf delighted us with local cuisine throughout our stay which made our stay quite memorable. The staff was courteous and efficient. However the food served in restaurants is no where close. We visited the restaurant on the last day before leaving for airport and were quite disappointed with the food and service. It was quite chaotic too. 

The USP of this property is its location. We preferred the sea facing room with a balcony a living room and bedroom. In my opinion, the rooms could have been bigger for the price particularly the bathrooms. Amazing view from the bedroom of the sea. It was truly mesmerizing. 

The favorite part of the stay is the access to the Taj Holiday village which is adjacent to this property for no additional cost and availability of internal transport for pickup and drop. Taj Holiday village makes up for access to the beach with larger landscape area which is limited to this property since it is built over a hill slope. 

I strongly recommend this place for food and great location. Must visit once.",1
319,"We stayed here for two nights. Located in the happening North Goa, just overlooking the sea, the property is a beautiful one. We lived in a Garden view room. The room was good, clean and tidy. However, they only provided one club glass and one pair of slippers, which was odd. The food is good and their servings are enough for two people, which I found good. The breakfast was also amazing. The staff is very courteous and always ready to help. The hotel is next to beach, so if u want to do have a swim or do water sports, everything is available in one go. When we were out for sightseeing for the day, coming back we noticed that our room was not cleaned. That was a slight disappointment. However, the room was cleaned in a jiffy, when informed. I think the hotel is due for renovation. All in all a good property and worth a visit, but I have stayed at vivanta by taj, kovalam and that was a much better experience.",1
320,"We were here for our anniversary. They made sure it was special. They were allowing us to have meals at their holiday Village hotel as well. So we got to taste food from both the hotels. They have a good spa but it closes at 7pm, which is bad as one would want to access the spa after beach. you get a good view of the Sea from the rooms on 1st floor.",1
321,"We had stayed for 3 nights and the stay was really good except for some minor stuff


We expect something from a 5 star resort and we get that pretty much without any compromises.

Rooms are in a terrain but no worries you are picked up and dropped from anywhere to anywhere within the hotel premises.

Other advantage is you also have access to the Holiday Village Taj Vivanta which is also close by and you can also have breakfast in that location.You can also use the facilities of The Holiday Village Taj.

I loved the pool of Taj Holiday Village which is bigger and also has a kids pool which we could use.

The breakfast spread was very good. 
As I had been on the Diwali eve there was Pooja and minimal fireworks to entertain the guests.


Overall it was a very good stay.",1
322,"We had taken a sea view room, it was very good view and very peaceful. Swimming pool water was warm at 27 degrees and we really enjoyed. Access to beach was easy and the beach was clean with decent activities. Food quality was very average and could certainly be improved. We had to get food changed several times but room service guys were happy to change it. Staff was very nice and friendly. Rooms with sit out on ground floor were better than even suites (especially one closer to the lobby as there is no privacy there because garden outside lobby overseas the balcony and we did not enjoy our stay there as much as ground floor). Overall worth it!!",1
323,"Stayed here with my husband and friend from 10th until 14th October 2016 - a total of 4 nights. Taj Hotels very kindly upgraded us into 2 amazing Villas, because we were moved from the Taj Exotica, where the BRICS Summit was taking place. We were compensated for all the inconvenience by being given Villa 510 and 511 - very recently renovated just one month ago - up the hill from the main part of the hotel. Our accommodation was stunning and exceedingly comfortable, and we were told just to phone for the driver, any time we wanted to be transported down to the hotel.
The hotel is very nice overall - very nice food in all of the restaurants, (we ate breakfast there every day and also ate in the Italian restaurant and the Seafood Restaurant; lovely staff - especially the guys out at the poolside; great access to the beach and also to the Fort; and we were extremely well looked after.
This is a lovely hotel and I would not hesitate to recommend it.",1
324,"Stayed here for 3 night, as we got an amazing all meals deal from the hotel. Though there was initial delay in getting the room, the awesome service by the staff covered it up. The food was excellent with the restaurant staff being prompt and assist us warmth and a smile always, Kudos to Prabhakant ( restaurant manager) and his team. 
The house keeping to an awesome job to keep the hotel and the rooms clean. The only drawback is the hotel doesn't have a elevator as it built on a remain of a fort. Overall an amazing and relaxing stay.",1
325,"We visited taj fort aguada from 12 to 16 jan 2017. Excellent place to stay
excellent location 
wonderful beach just next 2D Resort food was tasty all staff were helpful and signature taj service....smart but not oversmart. 
Cons.......needs renovation. Though evrrything is preserved well and all irregularities well covered due to good housekeeping still....
Our room the premium indulgence cottage was good but not lavish...at more than 20 k per night...we expect more.... Like more space...betr interiors...i felt at any other property i would have got a betr room....but the location the food the sea outdoors more than made up for the room.",1
326,The location of the property is outstanding with access to the beach quite easy and painless. The property is also extremely well maintained even though the villas are quite spread apart. The breakfast spread is really good with service being quite up to the mark. The lunch buffet and banquet food however could have been much better and the only reason not giving it a 5 star.,1
327,It was a nice stay. Excellent decor. Good rooms with beautiful view of sea and beach. Excellent private balcony overlooking the beach. Pool is very good. House keeping is efficient. Stay was very comfortable. However staff at reception need to be proactive. I had to wait for three hours before room was allotted. They even forgot to offer welcome drink or even a glass of water which I was not expecting at least here. Activity department the facility of making those key chains and other articles with your photos is very good. Over all it was a comfortable stay. Thank you so much for for making our trip memorable.,1
328,"A really lovely hotel, hidden away the noise and madness of Candolim, yet a quick walk into town to get into the mix of it! Comfy spacious rooms, nice golf course and swimming pool and The Bayan Tree restaurant on site is absolute perfection!",1
329,"before i review the hotel i must mention the shortage of money in candolim. we returned on the 8th and at that time the queue at atms where a hour for max of 2000inr per day.N o offical shops where open for exchange and if you can find someone to change your money the rate comes down to 70 to 72 inr to the ...The best we did was find restaurants who would accept english to pay the bill at 80 to the  .It does not make a relaxing holiday looking for money every day
The hotel changed money but it was 5000inr per room per week or 5000inr per person per week depending on who you asked at reception
Despite this the hotel it self is lovely .The staff are helpful and can not do enough to make your stay restful.The view from reception and our room was excellent the down side is that on rooms beginning 2 there is no balcony .free water and fruit inthe room every day .Breakfast was of good quality with nice range of curries
if you get fed up of curries try ruffles for amazing pie
the hotel gave us free transportation to the airport it also offers free shuttle to the taxi rank at the bottom of the road but haggle over the fare",1
330,"Vivanta by Taj  Fort Aguada, Goa is at its best. Romantic, Charming, Vibrant. It has history woven in its walls. This is where royalty, heads of government agencies and the biggest celebrities are known to frequent. The first luxury hotel in Goa. Get an experience that no other place has been able to recreate.",1
331,"The property has a scenic view of the beach,well maintained environment and polite staff add to its glory.Staying here I would suggest the beach view rooms either family or business this is the best property to stay.They also allow the guests to visit the nearby Taj Holiday Village and transport for the same is arranged complimentary.",1
332,"We went to Taj Vivanta - Fort Aguada for our 1st wedding anniversary and needless to say had selected the romantic package to make sure its special. While the hotel is well maintained with decent enough restaurants and pool some things still need improvement - the beach is not private and we didn't know that so had to adjust to a beach that is left to general public but this was not as big a spoiler as the fact that we had to literally ask the hotel staff to give us what we were entitled for in the package such as complimentary anniversary dinner, breakfast-in-bed etc. This was not a very pleasant feeling coz it them lost its meaning and the special moments we were looking forward for it being creating - imagine you going and asking that this is what we are supposed to get so pls give it to us..........this was definitely not very professional. Bu this was balanced by the warm hopitality shoed by some very dedicated hotel staff like Kumar Vaibhav in Latitude and the manager and chef of the Italian restaurant Ilcamino. With a slight improvement in professionalism towards guest management, this place is among the best resorts in North Goa.",1
333,"Decor not upto the Mark at all
Facilities nice 
Spa nice 
Over priced 
The staff is so good they make up for everything lacking 
Taj hotels really trains their staff like no other Hotel brand 
The foreign brands offer better decoration, perhaps more value for money but could never compete with the homely welcome Taj hotels give their guests 
Taj goes the extra mile to serve their guests 
Other brands go the extra mile to make their guests spend more ",1
334,"Stunning property. The fort is an icing on the cake. Location wise good since its 10 mins drive from a lot of sought after pubs/clubs & eating places as well. Food is excellent, staff very helpful. Loved our 4 day stay !",1
335,"The best part about my stay was the service. They were friendly, sincere and efficient. I had a deluxe sea view and the room was nice but smaller than I would have expected. Another downside of the room was that it had an adjoining door. Definitely request a room without this. I could hear everything in the other room. I asked to change rooms but they were full the whole time I was there. Also, ask to be away from any stairs. It wasn't as quiet as I would have liked. The bed was a little harder than I would have liked, too. I don't want to give a bad impression. Overall, I was very happy with my stay and would stay again. The breakfast buffet was quite good with many options. I hired a driver, Francis, for a few days to take me sightseeing and I found that price to be reasonable. However, I did find it overpriced to get a quick drop down to the main area of Candolim.",1
336,A fabulous property in the heart of GOA. Warm friendly efficient service. Recommend this hotel highly. Staff are friendly and look after all your needs. Understand their customers well and make sure they are comfortable.,1
337,"Well as the name suggest its a TAJ brand.... right from the pick u service at the airport to the hotel. 

This was second trip to Goa at the starting of 2017 

quick check in process & then you come to the wonderfull villa.

Food is awesome... 


Its worth the money you pay at the end of the day.",1
338,"We stayed at Taj Aguda in the first week of Feb 2017. 


They have two properties next to each other and guests can use the facilities of both. Both the restaurants at Taj Aguda are good. 


Good location! The have access to Fort Aguda and the beach directly from the property. They have access to Jiva Spa and tennis courts etc. through fort Aguda. 


Try to get the sea facing room on a higher floor. The view is amazing!


The breakfast is average but the spread is good. ",1
339,"You cannot beat the property's location within the Ramparts of the Fort and with immediate beach access. The grounds are fantastic, service was great and the rooms were clean, large and well appointed. We took a garden sit-out room which still had a great sea view and a nice terrace. 

The only problem was food prep. We were in India for a month and avoided any major food problems even though my wife has a severe seafood/fish allergy. In Goa we ate nowhere but the resort. On the evening of the fourth night, we ate in their Italian restaurant (by the way, the cream sauces were far to heavy and cloying to be enjoyed). By 3 am that night we were both violently ill and remained so for at least 36 hours. We are well seasoned travellers and have been ill in the past, but nothing like this. While nothing is certain, we cannot imagine how we could have contracted it any other way. Hotel staff were responsive and helpful but this should not happen in a high level resort. A couple of mornings later, I watched as one of the chefs preparing eggs in the breakfast buffet, dropped his spatula, chased it across the floor, picked it up and immediately stuck it back in the omelet he was preparing. Several other staff witnessed this but no one seemed concerned.",1
340,"Stayed in the property for 5 days last year around June. Hotel was in very good condition and renovation work was already in progress to make the condition better. However, whatever the condition was,we got the luxury experience we expect from TAJ. Food is good and I would suggest trying all three restaurants. We stayed in the college with a garden view and sea views suite in the main building. Cottage is spacious but no view of sea and MY SUGGESTION goes for only sea view suite. Rooms is small but view is to die for.

Happy to help if people need more information",1
341,"We decided on Goa last minute for a relaxing break in the sunshine and it's exactly what we got! The location of the Taj is fabulous for the beach and the shops and restaurants, and the villa we had was perfect for a short walk to the restaurant for breakfast,so very happy with that! Breakfast was great, fresh fruit and cereals and chefs to cook anything you wanted. There were three restaurants to choose from and we tried them all, none of them was disappointing, and the food and ambience was very good. The villa was spacious and clean and the bathroom was ticked with plenty of amenities which were restocked daily, as was the water, plenty of bottles which was amazingly good. The manager held an afternoon tea for us on our last day, which was a lovely gesture, all the staff were very happy and helpful the whole time. The only downside was the dogs on the beach, there were so many all the time, sticks were available when we collected towels for the sun beds, to scare them away! The complex was very close to a street full of shops and restaurants so we walked out a few times, but taxis were plentiful and very cheap, we did struggle to get some local money as the ATM s were running out but everywhere took debit cards so no problem. I was pleasantly surprised that there were no mosquitoes or flies which was a bonus, and the sea water was warm although quite rough at times, I would go back again but maybe choose a front line beach villa next time.",1
342,"The service was excellent. 
We had asked for a deluxe room which was not in the main
building - we needed a pickup & drop from our room which came promptly.
The room was great - large & well furnished.
The location is far from airport & the nearest town & a little inconvenient to walk anywhere as we are elderly. Amenities are all very good. 
The breakfast was great but the other meals rather disappointing. We got a cold noodle dish one night & an overdone hamburger another night. Although we complained we were still charged with no apology.This is the reason i have given 4 stars. Avoid restaurants for dinner.Most nights we ate out. The bar is a great place to hang out & take in the sea view. We walked on the beach every evening - the best part of our 6 night stay.",1
343,"Rooms and bathrooms are bad .... food is good .... pool is good ..... old rooms .... staff is good .... so better stay at some other hotel as bathroom is really small... housekeeping is bad ... if u ask anything they will say they are trainees. ... go for meals to visit the property and stay anywhr else.... as beach is also dirty with beer bottles any polybags.....

344,Taj once again did not disappoint.. The rooms food buffet service hospitality were all commendable.. Did not enjoy the spa that much as it was heavily booked and the whole experience felt a little rushed..,1

+Well appointed spacious rooms
+Very courteous and helpful staff.
+ All your needs are taken care off.
+Brilliant location.",1
346,"An amazing property overlooking sea. We were there around new years. they have the best staff, good food. their lounge which is perfect to have a drink and enjoy the beauty. the restaurant by the pool and live music makes it more than perfect.",1
347,One of the oldest pioneering five star of Goa. 2 hours from the airport through Calangute one of the finest district of Goa. Taj Aguada is at the tip of the heritage fort bastions from where one can virtually enjoy and experience the vastness of Arabian sea. The sea view rooms are amazing over the villas and cottages. Whoever goes there cannot miss the hilltop yet again encountering the infinity of the water. Lush green but details seems poor against other Taj properties. Adventure activities are interesting. Adjoining Taj Village is worth visiting.,1
348,"e stayed here for 2 night and loved the place. The place and the food options are really good here, just that the place is not well maintained. There was some renovation going on at the property but was so well taken care of, if not mentioned we would not really notice it as well. I would recommend the stay here, though the ones with kids would love the holiday village property more.",1
349,"A good place for stay - neat and clean with courteous helpful staff.
I stayed in the place during monsoons - so trip from rooms to Reception / dining/conference area through cab was irksome in the rains - the pathways at night could be better lighted.
Small beach there but was rough so no one ventured.
Good location for view of the sea.
Food is good - the service can be faster though.
The Brinjal sweet sour pickle was delicious and something I tasted first time.
All in all a nice place.",1
350,The property is nice and good to go to every time we go to Goa. The cottages are very nice and clean. and are on the top of hills. The rooms are ok ok and have a good lawn in front of the rooms overlooking Arabian sea. The property is huge and has a ferry service to the cottages and the other places in the property. There is only 1 problem that is that this hotel has not elevator to go to upper floors. Which is a big turn off.,1
351,"Physically impressive hotel in a lovely commanding setting and and fine gardens, with access to adjoining Vivanta village offering more gardens and another impressive pool. Room had magnificent sea view and good air conditioning, reasonable facilities. Beginning to look tired though, with disappointing shower over bath, and very grimy grouting in bathroom. A surprise considering how many staff are employed doing very menial tasks around the grounds.
Adjoining beech is very long, very sandy and is sadly ruined by over development, with endless beach shacks and noisy thrill riders on jet-skis and towed bananas. The local tourists think nothing of throwing their beer and spirit bottles into the sea after a days heavy drinking, especially at weekends, this makes the beach a potential hazard. The sea is likely heavily polluted with sewerage from the over development. Whilst outside the hotel's control all this unfortunately detracts from the lovely hotel and diminishes its appeal. 
Booked via Thomson's in UK with a half board option to avoid having to find potentially risky food outside, this being our first time to India. Staff were very unsure of our status and kept offering a restrictive choice menu and not the a la carte, this confusion continued into second week. Not a fault of the staff but one of communication from above. Unfortunately contaminated food eaten in hotel resulted in severe illness for 10 days, with parasitic stomach infection. Likely cause of contamination was birds and vermin seen in open restaurants, which has access to completely open restaurant and kitchen areas at some of the properties restaurants. Mice and crows seen inside. Birds plague guests outside at pool, they use the pools for bathing and drinking, leaving excrement everywhere, and riffle through unguarded belongings. The hard working staff struggle to keep them at bay, and birds sit on tables laid for evening meals. several members of same party fell ill whilst on full or half board, those who ate in shacks and restaurants outside did not fall ill.
Cost of drinks is prohibitive, over 7 for single G&T, locally acceptable Gin only 1.50 a bottle in supermarket. Result is hotel misses out on massively on sales and the ambience of pre-dinner drinks, which people take elsewhere. Dinner can become a dry affair, if you love wine forget it, you will be made bankrupt.
A holiday thoroughly ruined by avoidable food contamination. Will never return.",0
352,"I would not stay here again. Some of the staff was excellent, some was fine, some just lied to us.

We chose this property as we have Taj Inner Circle Gold membership. When checking in we handed over a room upgrade certificate and were given a very nice villa on the hills. Unfortunately, the villa we were given was directly next to a villa that was under construction - and there was lots of hammering and disruption. So we asked to switch to a regular room, which was accommodated. Our excitement at the upgrade was now a bit diminished, but we still had very high hopes for the property.

On our day of check out, we asked for a 2 pm check out (Taj Inner Circle Gold offers a 4 pm check out). We had also mentioned this at check in and had been told it shouldn't be an issue. But on the day of check out we were told that, as check in time was also 2 pm and they were sold out that night, it was impossible to also have a 2 pm check out. This defies logic, so we pushed back. The desk agent then said fine, we could have the 2 pm check out, but if anyone was trying to check into that room before then and couldn't because we were in the room they would just be told it was our fault so the incoming guest could complain to us. I have not been treated so rudely by even a 1 star hotel, let alone a Taj property.

Mentioned above that the agent also told us they were sold out that night. We asked some other staff at the hotel. I forget the exact numbers, but the hotel has around 140 rooms. That day 90 rooms were checking out and 40 were checking in. This means that even if the hotel had been sold out the night before (irrelevant for our 2 pm check out) there were at least 50 vacant rooms that day, so this was easy to accommodate. Instead the staff is trained to say no at first and hope the ""guests"" just go away. This is not the type of management that I would want to reward with future revenue. There are plenty of other nice properties in Goa that are far more worthy of your money. True lack of caring here.

I expect someone at the property to respond in the name of the GM and say how the hotel did nothing wrong, since they're unable to face criticism.",0
353,Beautifully located by the coast but sadly the food was very lacking. Too much salt in many of the dishes and they even served up unripe avocados. Extremely expensive for what we got. Only came for lunch so can't comment on anything else.,0
354,"All the positives are already highlighted by other posts. 

This is an old hotel which is more like a 3 Star with aging facilities and arrogant management.

It's suitable only for business meetings because that is their priority and holiday guests are unwanted. Not suitable for families with small children.

This can qualify as the worst hotel in goa. Please book in hyatt or marriot for 5 Star service.",0
355,"I am afraid to say is it Taj !!!?
We were in 2 deluxe allure terrace suites but Bathrooms are very claustrophobic and Small like cheap guest house! 
Coffee shop cutlery and cup saucers and teapots need to be cleaned properly! !
In coffee shop house keeping staff don't have manners that while guests are eating at the table that time they should not Clean Pillars next to tables and splash soapy water on guests and their food !!! Simple Hygiene sense they should have it .they stopped after complain.
Front desk staff and duty manager are more interested in swiping cards for bills. Not bothering for customer satisfaction !
We will not come again and will not recommend anybody.

My room was room number 203 The rooms on the second level are old , grimy and are in need for an instant update for the amount of money taj is charging for it.. Although the staff is courteous but these guys have nothing to offer in terms of a 5 star property which you expect from a taj property. 
The restaurants are dated the rooms are disgusting to say the least ..I then got my booking changed to the taj holiday village which too seems dated now. My advice is stay at the newer hotels in north goa because Taj is just not worth it...",0

Room no 228 has washroom lock problem ,
Room no 232 has some seepage problem and there was an power cut out at 4 pm on 29th september , some elctrician attended and took 2 hours to correct it.
Management really poor .
No ways a taj property or 5 star standards.
Only thing good about the same is location.
Just thought of moving out but had paid complete in advance ...",0
358,"I stayed at Fort Aguada in the month of June, I expected the hotel to be clean and luxurious but it turned out to be just the opposite. I spent four nights and had to change the room every single night because of several problems firstly, with their cottages and then with their Junior suites as well. I have stayed in properties all across the globe but never has my dissatisfaction level been higher, the hotel rooms at Fort Aguada are very old and not well maintained as the property must looks very old. For this price, i feel there can be so many better options for the guests.
The swimming pool is very small and the hotel has very poor spa facility for a property that is spread across 45 acres of land.",0
359,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights and we thought the hotel was pretty poor. There were a small handful of positives - there were a couple of examples of excellent service and there is a Thai restaurant (albeit at the sister hotel next-door) which is first rate. But overall, the quality of the experience falls far below what would you should expect for the price.

As others have noted, the rooms are very tired and desperately in need of renovation. I see from the hotel's responses to other reviews that modernisation work will happen but that's of no use if you're staying in a shabby room. It's not as though it's any cheaper to account for the poor state of the rooms.

Another issue we had was the level of service which was generally poor. There were countless examples every day but to pick out a handful... On a few occasions, we ordered things at breakfast which didn't arrive. We booked a double room with a king bed (we are married after all) but we were given twin beds - they put the beds together but then we had no lamps by the bed. After we complained, they moved us but only the following day. We called reception at 1 a.m. on the first night to ask when the thumping music outside would finish - we were promised a call back which never materialised. We received a welcome pack for a wedding that was nothing to do with us, we were charged for wi-fi (in a 5 star hotel, in 2016!), there were mix ups over taxi payments, I could list loads.

And finally, this is a very noisy resort hotel - it's very difficult to properly relax. In addition, to the late night music, you'll get noise from the rooms above and each side. Breakfast is like eating in a school canteen. On the first day, we managed to get one of the few tables to eat breakfast outside but one of the staff was using a noisy machine to blow up a zorb water ball. And the pool activities go on through the day so forget about a peaceful time sun bathing and reading by the swimming pool.

I've stayed previously at the Taj Exotica in South Goa and that was a wonderful experience - a much better prospect for your holiday!",0

361,"We went to Goa for the Republic Day long weekend and booked this basis what several people we know had told us. First the good things - staff were very courteous and responsive, the lobby and common areas are nice, breakfast pretty comprehensive and the overall look of the gardens very nice. And the not so nice - the room quality was shabby and there were places which were a little dirty ( we were told the hotel is going to get renovated but these rooms were clearly not upto the mark) , and on the first day we had to remind housekeeping to clean our room . When they cleaned they did not replenish the coffee and creamer and again we had to remind them. once we reminded the staff were very prompt but the fact we had to remind at all put us off. 
Most importantly, this resort is just not worth the price paid - there is no private beach ( and the approach to the beach is narrow and one gets accosted by private operators trying to sell water sports ), and for hanging out in shacks or by the beach there are far better options at far lower prices. The kids play area was so tiny it was laughable.even if the service had been what we would have expected from the Taj I would not recommend this hotel at all. Far better options to enjoy the beaches, shacks and roam around on a motorbike",0

The trip started on a bad note...the AC in the pick-up coach did not work...we went through 2 hours of torture in the suffocating bus.

request made and it seemed they just avoided it out somehow.You might not even get what you asked for and then accuse for poor service is that some conferance is going on in the hotel If that is so then they should not take the booking during the time of some events.They are just spoiling the image of taj hotels",0

Sad to say for the amount they charge the rooms were miniscule in size as compared to their other cheaper properties elsewhere in Goa.Breakfast wasn't complimentary nor were there any welcome drinks or fruits or cookies placed in our room. More than half the hotel was under renovation which made for a depressing ambience, they could have slashed their rates, at least to make up for that.
I feel the staff could have done something to make our visit special especially for the kids since on arrival they made us fill out a detailed questionnaire about our kids' likes and dislikes as regards food and activities. Sadly it was a very average stay in an average hotel with exceptionally high room tariff!",0

There was a lovely singer on for the evening but we could not hear anything due to the very very loud Christmas music from the shack right next to us on the beach. After dinner we were unable to move to anywhere else, as the seats near the stage were taken by other diners, so we decided to leave. We told reception we were not happy and were leaving, they didn't ask why.
We had ordered a taxi and asked if we could leave a note at the gate house to let the driver know we had left and that we would still pay him when we saw him the next day. The hotel staff were dumfounded that we cared about the cab driver and said it was not necessary to leave a note as they will tell him we had left. They didn't ask our names so I don't know how they would do that. We waited outside for a cab for a few minutes and then someone came and said we had to order one at the desk.. The desk said taxi would be 6.50 to go less than a mile?? I told them never mind we will walk, the taxi there cost 2. As it happened we got a taxi as soon as we set off and paid 2.50.
I would not return to this hotel even if I won the lottery, some of the staff especially the males think they are something special. The idea that they think they can rip people off on the taxi drivers behalf is incredible ow do they explain that? . They need to remember their customers pay their wages and stop being so smug.",0
374,"I was there for for nights in October with my parents, and we stayed in a one-bedroom sea view villa in the Ermitage part of the resort. I've spent many cherished summer vacations here in my childhood, but we switched over to the Exotica about ten years ago, and this was our first time back since then-- and my, how the mighty have fallen! It rained heavily throughout our vacation (since it was the monsoon season), and a lot of water managed to seep in through the full length windows in the bedroom of the villa on our first evening itself-- after a few repeated calls, they sent one person with a tiny cloth who cleaned it, and never sent anyone to fix the problem till we created a ruckus the next morning. We ordered a huge meal from room service, but most of the food tasted a little stale, the prawns in our prawn dish were straight-up straight and smelly-- imagine this, STALE seafood in GOA! That too, at a five-star, where you're paying like 800 bucks for the dish! Then the next morning, it turned out that there was no hot water in the master bathroom, and while the third person was having their bath in the smaller bathroom, the hot water stopped running there too. There were people in our villa fixing it all day-- it felt like we were sitting at our home while there was renovation work going on, and it was just not done, because you should check and make sure everything in a room/villa is working the way it should be before you check guests into it. In addition, the bathrooms were mouldy and old-feeling, and the villa felt a little rundown in general-- this is something I read in a LOT of reviews before coming here, but I kept thinking, how bad could it be? It's the Taj, after all! To be fair, they are renovating different parts of the hotel in phases, but they should probably shut the whole place down and do it in one go, rather than jipping off guests who are assigned the non-renovated accommodations. The general manager was away during our stay, so we dealt mostly with the desk manager, and I suspect it was because my dad is a Chambers member (and made his anger and displeasure very clear), but that night, they moved us into the neighbouring villa, which was a renovated sea view two-bedroom, and gave us a free meal at the Banyan Tree (in Taj Holiday Village), and thankfully everything worked just fine there. However, the overall experience left a bad taste in our mouths, and we are unlikely to ever return here-- which is a pity, because although Exotica is a far superior hotel, the Aguada property is definitely more interesting and beautiful.",0
375,"Aright...so my review of this place might read differently from the others'. 

Maybe it was just the time of the year that we decided to be at Vivanta Aguada ...for the New Years. Maybe it was too many guests...or maybe it's just as I experienced it. Not much, however, could be reasoned given that it's hospitality from start to end. 

Front office -- below average responsiveness. Unable to address the most basic demands...leave alone those that needed exceptions to be made. Despite repeated requests for as little as an hour's extension to the checkout time (after staying for 4 days)...we were, literally and figuratively, thrown out. Haven't had to experience that at a Taj property before. But then...

Room service -- possibly too many guests overloaded them, but it was sluggish and quality was far below the average Taj standards. 

Rooms/ Suites -- we used both owing to the size of our family. We were almost 25 of us. View from most of the rooms was exceptional. I give that to the property, where it's located. Interiors were dated...looked and felt poorly kept...and restrooms really did let one down. 

Overall -- the experience ranged between poor and average, as you can tell. But there's a silver lining - the property is beautiful...the view...the clean swimming pool...and the beach right in front. Fort Aguada is very beautiful. Maybe at another time of the year, Vivanta Aguada might deserve a chance. For me, I will take some time to get over this trip and reclaim it when I do. 
Have a good one!",0
376,"I have been going to this hotel for ages.
The property is now in a terrible state of disrepair.I was in one of the cottages and they really should not have been using the room.The shower door was practically falling off and after shower I had to mop the whole room.Sockets were not working, speakers in the ceiling seemed like they were about to fall down.
There did not seem to be any concern about the room even though I was moved. Looking out of the room I could see other cottages literally falling apart.
No free wifi, in this age there are not many hotel chains that do not offer this service.( i was told by some of the staff this is a big complaint).
On the plus side a receptionist was great, a waiter in Latitude restaurant went over and above what was expected. 
Time to spend some money on the property!!
The staff are great but what a shame no managers and even the general manager don't care!",0
377,"While the Vivanta by Taj, Fort Aguada property is fantastic, I found the service to be below standard for such a high priced property. 
I was disappointed as I had gone to celebrate my wedding anniversary. While the check in staff noted the occasion, not even a courtesy wish from the staff.",0
378,"We went as a couple to Goa and stayed at the Taj for 4 nights.

We used the shuttle service at the airport to get to the hotel. The Taj staff at the airport were very courteous and helpful. The drive to the hotel takes about an hour and a half and usually the shuttle drops passengers off first the the holiday Village and then at Fort Aguada.

The location of the Fort Aguada hotel turned out to be very inconvenient. It is at an isolated corner of the North Goa beaches and is far from convenience stores, restaurants and the main beach areas of the Calangute, Anjuna and Baga.

It takes 15 minutes to walk down to the Holiday Village and the way is not very nice either. Taj do provide a free cab service between the two properties. This is particularly important because the taxi stand is located outside the main gate of the Holiday Village.

The taxis provided by Taj are very convenient and a safe option. But the prices are exorbitant to say the least. On one evening we used the taj taxi to go to a nearby restaurant called Earthen Oven, since it was raining. We were charged Rs. 650 for this ride, when a regular taxi would probably drop you off at Baga for 400-500.

Bear in mind that due to the location of the hotel you will end up spending a fair amount in taxis.
One word of advice; if you travel to a place and intend on traveling back to the hotel in a couple of hours then retain the taxi, since it usually works out cheaper.
Petrol is the cheapest in Goa compared to the rest of India, so taxi operators look to profit heavily from tourists.

We had a sea view room with a sit out. While the view was very good the room was not.
The entire property has tired feel to it and does not seem to be in very good repair.

There is a gate besides the pool which provides you access to the beach and one of the Fort Aguada ramparts.

We checked in around 3:30 PM and were asked to wait, although the rooms should have been ready by then. When we went to the room the floor was still damp. There wasn't any coffee in the room.
We had been provided 2 towels and both seemed different. On inquiring we were told that one was an old towel and the other a new towel.
These were promptly addressed when pointed out.

One very poor observation which I have made is that the Taj do not provide spoons to stir tea/coffee. rather they provide alcohol stirrers. I have stayed in a few hotels around the world, but have never been provided stirrers for coffee. I think this speaks a great deal about the Management of this hotel.

What happened on the third day was quite sad. We waited in the sit out area while one of the staff made up the room. After he left we were surprised to find that he had not replaced any coffee and the towels were not right again.
What was shocking was the fact that he had replace the bedsheet with a new one which was completely torn off at the edge and there is no way he could have missed it.
The linen at the Taj is not very clean at all, but using torn bedsheets is simply not acceptable.

The pool at the hotel was fine, although we spotted a few crows drinking from the pool.

The property has a lot of crows and they can become unnerving when you use the sit out in the morning. Clearly the Management have not bothered with doing anything about this menace.

The breakfast was good but not exceptional in any way. We noticed a lot of families lifting food from the breakfast area, probably for the rest of the day, and no one seem too concerned about this behaviour.

Overall, the entire experience was quite disappointing and not what we paid for. This is my second stay at a Taj, the first being at Taj Samudra in Colombo. I think it is safe to say that the Taj will be my last option in the future.

Taxi fares for Baga will be around 400 for non-A/C and 500 for A/C if you use private cabs.

Make it a point to visit Souza Lobo's and Brittos if you visit North Goa.

379,"Where do I start from....
The excitement of staying at Taj evaporated at the check in itself. We had booked a king bed, but at the check in the receptionist tells me that we are booked for twins beds (first shocker). I showed her the print of my reservation which clearly said King Bed. She took the print of my reservation and went inside and returned after few minutes while we waited, she came back and informed us that we are all set (we assumed that we are all set for king bed room). We went inside the room to find out two twin beds joined together to create A PSEDUO KING BED (second shocker). We were shocked beyond limits. I spoke to the duty manager and our room was changed,obviously my question to him was why were we CHEATED AND FOOLED. He ""instructed"" me that I should first have my room changed and then discuss thw matter, he went on to tell me that the receptionist had informed us that twin beds would be joined to make a kind bed (third shocker), this conversation had never taken place. 
In a state of shock I requested to meet the GM who apologisied but did nothing beyond that till my knowledge. We received a sorry card in room which was nice and kind gesture. 

Location of the hotel is the only saviour of the hotel which is breath taking.

Service (minus the receptionist) was excellent.

Food lacks taste and variety. 

Overall mixed review, recommended only for location nothing else AT ALL.",0
380,The letters missing from the security sign on the gate is the first clue to a distinct lack of management at this property. This is reinforced by the lukewarm welcome from front desk staff who go through the motions but clearly have been given no inspiration as to what service is all about. The property is getting a little worn but that would not be a problem if the staff were managed as opposed to being on unaware autopilot. Note to the Taj Brand CEO. You might want to retrain the GM urgently. Too late for this customer. It will be the Hyatt for me next time.,0
381,"Day-1
Representative at Goa airport named Govind, offered a coach for transportation from Goa to Hotel.
Booking was done through booking.com after confirming from hotel reservation that what kind of transportation is being offered. It was confirmed that it two way transportation by car. 
After wasting 20 minutes car was offered from taxi stand. 
Refusal was from Govind as well as duty manager 

List of pick up has been attached here for evidence.

Duty manager valenkho was there who tried to resolve the issue, who claimed to be duty manager but official I'd not displayed. 

TJ was also claims to be duty manager, he has been informed. He said he will resolve the issue. I am waiting for his inputs on day two.",0
382,Not worth for money. No cleanliness. No amenities. Staff is not good . Better to go Raddisson or Hayatt in this price. It's not a five star property at all. Staff of hotel not cooperative. Small rooms. Not the same as shown in pictures. So I advise not to do any mistakes. Don't book this hotel.,0
383,"I would like to have a sincere word with the GM of the hotel of Goa property. I would like to report many things right from from the watchmen's promptness to the arrogance reply of the Latitude restaurant captains . Sincerely not recommended to stay at this hotel . Goa being a major sea food destintion which has a peculiar goan taste was not at all catered . The following points were observed and detailed.


1)we reached the hotel at around 3 pm on 25th September , no one was bothered to receive us at the reception . No welcome drink was offered at the facility. We had to wait for our chance to talk to the reception person for around 15 mins. No briefing about the property was done after we checked in. P.S . We drove from Pune to Goa with our own vehicle. (Not expected from TAJ hospitality)

2) next day 26th Sept at breakfast we ordered a glass of watermelon juice we were denied arrogantly by the captain at hotel Latitude . Finally requesting after 2-3 times to the lady who welcomes at the reception desk of latitude restaurant she told the same captain who was arrogant to us to serve us the juice. While giving the juice the captain said that he thought we were ""outsiders"" and not the guest staying at the hotel. Is this how you really treat the customers whether outsiders or the ones staying in the property? 

While having food in the afternoon there were a group of people hooting and howling and shouting slang words which the faculty could handled , being with family this is not at all accepted .

3) Same day we visited to the ""seafood"" special restaurant Morisco there. We ordered for the Goan seafood special thali, it was really a disgrace to the Goan cuisine. Being fisheaters ourselves to the bone, taste of the typical Goan curry was totally bad. King fish fry served was dehydrated and not fresh. Rice served was dry and undercooked. Our expection of the taste and what we got was did not match. Roti/ naan served was chewy and lacked of taste. We called upon the chef and reported the problem. The same night he promised a meal which would match. The taste. The chef named mr. Ghanshyam Rege took care of that night with a much better taste and quality with his personal attention towards the cooking. I wish this would have been the case with the thali. But nevertheless first impression is the last. 

4) we checked out of the hotel on 28th September. After the breakfast we requested at the reception to make the final bill and formalities ready by 12 o clock. We reached the reception at 12 30 nothing is ready. Finally doing all formalities we got out of the hotel at 1 30 pm. Sluggish way of working. 

Overall I won't recommend or I dont think I will stay myself henceforth with this property. 

Regards
Shantanu Pandit.",0
384,"We were most disappointed to find ourselves in a cottage with mold in the bathroom and along one wall of the bedroom area...my husband became ill on the first night and I woke up ill the second day. On a tour of southern India, this was supposed to be the one hotel we were not worried about and it turned out to be the worse! We moved to the Taj Exotica and saved what was left of our four days...but we blame our travel agent for not warning us about the condition of the Fort. QuIte apart from the room, if you have any walking problems, you should know that the only way to get to the dining room or pool is to walk down four flights of steps...no elevator or buggy to get you down there. True, we were able to take a buggy ride to the nearby Taj VIllage and eat and swim, but that was a pain. When you check into a hotel that is supposed to be a luxury resort you do not expect to have to commute to dine or recline by the pool. The management responded by helping us move, but they and Taj need to get their act together. Taj Exotica was excellent!",0
385,"This hotel is very opulent inside and has a 5 star rating. It's location is spectacular near the point at Sinquerim. The views from this hotel are quite spectacular.
Staff on the gate at the start of the drive are very pleasant and staff inside the reception are pleasant enough - if a little slow to answer questions and lacking in local knowledge. 
However of startling concern is that they employ a man to organise traffic outside the gates of the hotel on the public road. One of those employed in this role exercises quite blatant racism towards white skinned people.
This hotel do not own this road - it is a public highway owned by the Government of Goa. There are no parking restrictions in this road, nor any signs concerning parking. It is an access road to a popular place in Sinquerim for watching the sunset.
Friends and I went to park two small scooters at the side of the road. There were many other vehicles parked along the side of this road including 4 wheelers and 2 wheelers. My friends and I were immediately pounced on by this man who told us we could not park there and harassed us until we got fed up and moved. He would not give us an alternative place to park and told us we could not park anywhere, despite many other vehicles being parked.
We then drove further along the public road to park on the verge - at this the Taj employee started yelling to a taxi driver who had parked and was getting out of his car, to tell us to move. The taxi driver gave us a place to park behind some buildings telling us that the Taj employee could not stop us there.
Having parked my scooter on private land behind a restaurant I saw the same Taj employee wave through a group of Indians on scooters and clearly direct them to the exact two places he had told us we could not park. 
I asked this man why - he laughed. I asked him if it because I am white skinned - he laughed and could give no justifiable reason for the differentiation in his behaviour towards my friends and I compared to the Indian people he had directed to the parking place.
I complained to the duty manager about this man's conduct to which the female duty manager's initial response was to claim this male was not one of their employees, then had to change her mind once I pointed out that he wore a staff identity badge and a Taj uniform! I was then promised a call back within 48 hours.....
...clearly the management of this hotel couldn't care less that they are employing a member of staff who exercises such vile racist behaviour to foreign nationals in Goa as no call back was received and no apology either.
Avoid this place if you have white skin - they exercise extreme and blatant racism.
Sadly this incident let the entire Taj brand down - the result being that I will never frequent any Taj establishment again",0
386,"Taj Vivanta
After staying in many Taj hotels in India and around the world- and after traveling to Goa from an outrageously grand stay at The Taj Palace in Mumbai this was my ABSOLUTE worst Taj experience and frankly a hotel to skip.Not at all deserving of the esteemed Taj moniker.
We selected the Taj Vivanta in Fort Aguada to visit Northern Goa and originally booked the hotel for 3 nights.
When we arrived we were shown to a cottage on a steep hillside that was dirty and run down and did not pass the cleanliness or smell test.Worse than rooms I stayed in during my budget student days.
The duty manager told us she thought the room was ""lovely and charming"" but would ""upgrade"" us to a more modern and seaside room if we took a walk on the beach for a few hours to have lunch.
When we arrived back to our newly assigned rooms a few hours later in the early evening they were much smaller and even dirtier than the first cottage with brown shower water and a host of crawling bugs.The man who assisted us with our luggage recently came from another hotel chain and told us he had received similar complaints from other customers.There were numerous blackouts and our TV and air conditioning were not properly working. In fact the following morning another guest and his wife were also complaining at the desk about the cleanliness of this property and told me that this was the worst hotel stay of their journey in Goa and India.
My wife wanted to immediately leave and the hotel management did absolutely nothing to resolve the issues despite gracious tips.The most unhelpful staff we have encountered after many months traveling in India or anywhere else for that matter over the past few years.
My wife was in tears.
I told them that we wanted to move to the Taj Exotica further south and was told by an assistant manager that it was completely sold out yet I was easily able to find rooms online on my own .
Management of the Taj Vivanta told me that I would have to pay for all of my booked days because they personally were unable to confirm availability at the other Taj (Exotica)which was complete nonsense.
After a sleepless first evening in a threadbare linen bed atop an old,uncomfortable and squeaky mattress - we left first thing in the morning and headed south to the Taj Exotica taking a chance without a reservation and we were welcomed with open arms and upgraded to an amazing suite after hearing our story.
To say that the difference between these two Taj Goa properties is night and day would be a great understatement.
The Taj Exotica in Goa was outrageously great(see my review) and exceeded expectations.I wholeheartedly and emphatically advise one against staying at the Taj Vivanta in Fort Aguada.
I have never been so adamant about my travel advise and have never written such a review.
In Fort Aguada there are much nicer places to stay at a fraction of the cost or just go right to the Taj Exotica which is more than great and take a cab ride to Fort Aguada for a visit.I have slept better in airports and on airplanes and the stress of this brief stay almost ruined an otherwise amazing journey.",0
387,"The reception was cold and unfriendly... The total lack of organisation and unfriendly approach left us feeling so disappointed that we turned around and went elsewhere - so we can't comment on the rest, but if you want to be treated like you are in prison just go the Taj. UK visitors be warned, there are much better places with friendlier approaches...",0
388,"I think this is the worst of the services meeted out by taj. Totally disappointed. Landed at the airport greeted by some ordinary person who made me wait for like 15mins to decide where am i going. Then another person comes and doesnt even answer. And then another wait of 30mins before i get boarding on the bus. Vallabh was the person handling the airport arrival. Inspite of charging so much and being on the gold epicure plus this is the treatment meeted out, very very disappointing never again will i visit this hotel",0

only thing we liked was the swimming coach sandeep.",0
390,"I am staying in the Superior Charm Sea View right now. We have triple occupancy. 
The rollaway bed caused back ache on first night so on the 2nd night asked them to put mattress on ground. The person who did this, was considerate to bring a thicker mattress.

Tonight (3rd night) again they put a roll away bed. After asking and reminding once to Ekta and waiting for 20 minutes, the housekeeping person comes and puts the mattress of roll away bed on floor.

This mattress is a very poor quality PU mattress of some local company that has long served its life. I have attached photos to show its low thickness (around 1.5 or 2 inches) and density might be 28 or 32. 

My father has served as a technical advisor to Sheela Foam (manufacturers of SleepWell) and I am a Chemical Engineer from IIT Delhi so I know something about PU mattresses and their technical parameters.

So I ask Ekta to replace the mattress. This time it takes 30 minutes and again no action. On asking Ekta, she tells me to speak to housekeeping. Finally at 11.10 after 30 minutes of wait, I ask her to escalate the call to Amrita, duty manager.

The mattress, thicker one this time as I had asked them to bring, finally materializes. There comes a boorish rude guy called Amit who gives me gyaan on how this poor quality, low density mattress that had gone flat and served its useful life, is actually perfect for roll away bed.

I want to ask if Taj is cutting corners this way. After all the third bed is charged. So why are such poor quality mattresses being used. Why is higher density mattress not being used. Why is a mattress that has obviously served its useful life being still used.

In response, I will much appreciate if the management talks ONLY about 3rd mattress because the mattresses in bed were spring mattresses and that is not the issue being discussed here.

We have had a few minor issues which I would have never mentioned otherwise (and not posted this review) but since the poor mattress and rude staff have already spoilt my sleep, I might as well mention here.

The bed sheet on day 2 was torn and had been stitched. I did not click photograph but it is something one does not expect from Taj.

Also, a person Rohit, at pool, forgot our tea order. Like simply forgot. I went to Latitude after 15 minutes wait and Sapna located him. He did apologize and said he would waive the charges and as I said we are here as a family enjoying so did not want to nit pick about minor things.

Most of the junior staff are truely service oriented, the cleanliness level is very high. In general the service orientation is there, all the things that one expects from Taj.

The 3rd mattress issue is something that should be addressed on a policy basis at Taj level because most users of 3rd mattress are children and they can not even highlight this. I have no doubt some accounting guy tried to pinch pennies by using the cheapest possible mattress they could. But when Taj charges an amount equivalent of cost of mattress as a single night supplement, it is criminal to use such 3rd class mattresses.",0
391,"If you are planning to travel with an infant this property is definitely not for you. To begin with rooms are very small and suffocating. There is no way to open the window either. More over due to 'condensation' one needs to keep the AC on at 21 degrees 24*7 else the floor, the walls and everything around starts getting wet. You cant leave your baby on the floor to crawl and play because of this. There is no option of a lift so you need to manage the stroller on your own. You can't trust the food served for babies as twice stale khichdi was served for my baby. In terms of food Taj Holiday Village seems far better with a wider spread and tastier food. Services are poor with a basic thing like tissue paper taking ages to be delivered to your table. If you have stayed in Exotica and Holiday Village, don't carry high hopes for this property. The only plus point is its location but then there is no beach. So every time you need to go to the beach you need to either access it through Taj Holiday Village or walk down to any other beach. Disappointed with the overall performance of this hotel.",0

To our surprise, there were lizards and flying cockroaches inside the cottages and after sanitizing and cleaning the rooms again, we had one more flying cockroach in the night n after complaining we were shifted to main building with very small rooms and floor was always wet due to some a/c issues.
The buffet food was not at all to the standard and me and my wife had severe food poisoning !! Being in Goa, you expect to see some Goan seafood delicacies but none were found in Lattitude restaurant and Morisco the seafood restaurant was also so so. We skipped out paid food packages and had food at Fat Fish and Souza Lobo outside which was much bettering authentic Goan food.

Checked out one day before than the paid package and decided never to check in Vivanta by Taj Ford Aguada again.

Moved again and again and again everyday I was packing and unpacking. 
Finally had last two days in a good room... Then had other issues, room which was supposedly allocated for us was occupied by someone else, we got the keys and opened the doors to find someone else's bags. Night before the departure we decided to clear all our bills, so the bills were all incorrect. Finally got the right bills paid them and then followed by emails after emails to say they again made a mistake and we paid less, checked the bills they were incorrect again and again and again.... We have been given a recipt of full payment received but still being told it was incorrect!!!!. Very upset and disappointed and found the whole experience disappointing and embarrassing. We paid one Lakhs rupees six months in advance and more on top for the extras and trust me I wish I never paid them or we should have just moved the next morning to some other hotel... Travelling from uk with two kids and all this hassle and not once the is any recognition of what we had gone through... We Will never recommend or go back . Bad outdated rooms with dirty linen and upholstery , tiny rooms for four people... The whole thing was a mess and a joke. We want our refund or attest some of our money back but once again we have not got anywhere due to complete arrogance of the front desk manager . Stayed in taj hotels all my life never exproeneced anything like it.... 
One of the front desk manager Amd many other managers used excuses like its a old hotel, it's due rennovation, sorry the room are outdated, sorry about the noise, we understand the pictures are not what you get but that the same when we take our pictures we want to look pretty .... Just outrageous kids were so unhappy and unsettled, they gave us one meal free on our first night which the front desk manager made such a song and dance about, whereas this was due to the fact that the room that we got was so bad and due to all the hassle and after 30 hours of our journey we could not go out to eat... Plus this was what I insisted not what was offered as a good will gesture or out of respect to us !!!! So angry and frustrated.....",0
400,"My friends and I had high hopes for the Vivanta by Taj hotel, we'd specifically booked this hotel hoping for a great 5 star experience. 

Our Taj adventure kicked off well, we got picked up from the airport without any issues and the check in procedure was smooth. Initial impressions of the hotel were good. 

However, the following morning, once we had recovered from the jet lag (we flew in from London), I discovered that the room wasn't as clean as we would like and indeed would expect. We found mushrooms growing in our bathroom door. We reported the issue and although the staff came in good time and sorted out the problem, the whole situation did leave us a little concerned about the cleaning standards of the hotel, especially as the friend I was sharing the room with suffers from various allergies and is asthmatic. 

Overall the staff at the hotel were lovely and very friendly and helpful, the only bad experience was with the manager right at the end who we felt brushed the whole mushroom and cleanliness issue under the carpet. 

Such a shame.",0
401,Extremely disappointed to know that this is a marriot chain of hotels. Disappointing rooms with loads of mosquitoes in it and arrogant staff. Even after being an silver elite member u r treated like this. Surprising and extremely disappointing. And my stay has just begun. The worst of the marriot properties i have ever stayed at. Please dont visit this if u want to take back a good experiencen of goa,0
402,"Stayed here for a week to ring in the New Year. On arrival our room was upgraded to a beautiful sea facing room with Sea view and balcony. Appreciate the gesture. Thank you. Unfortunately all the good things for us ended there. 

We're frequent visitors to this resort over the past decade, yet little has changed over time. The most disappointing is the in-room dining menu. We usually prefer personal touch to our food hence refrain from buffet. However visit to the Waterfront was quite appalling. Dirty cutleries. Ordinary ambience. Again nothing has changed over the decade. Service was however alright. 

New Years Eve.
Biggest disappointment. We've decided never to celebrate New Years eve at the Goa Marriott ever again. We booked at the last minute. The allocated table was not available. We waited for 30 mins for a table to be arranged. Finally we were allocated a so called premium arrangement to be shared with another quest after we decided to cancel the booking. The overall experience was quite disappointing. 

Food served in-room dining is extremely average. No taste. Worst we've tasted in any of the Goan resorts. Expensive and bad taste. 

On day of checkout the afternoon flight was cancelled and rescheduled late night. We were allocated an alternate room at no extra cost for late checkout. Great gesture. Thank you. However the room smelled puke. Horrible experience. Felt sorry to put my family through it just to avoid paying an additional day charge for a couple of hours stay. 

For sure we've decided never to visit the Goa Marriott ever again.",0
403,"We are all so horrified at the standards of this Marriott that we are going to contact the directors of Head Office. The place is falling apart. The rooms are shabby. Maintenance does not appear to be a thing. We paid extra for an ocean view room and could see a big palm tree. This is a 3 star masquerading as a 5 star. 
We checked in New Years Eve and were told there was a party until 1.30am RIGHT UNDER our room. We were annoyed. I'd also asked for one king bed room one twin next to each other. We got 2 twin. They'd got no room. Ok. They could move us the next day. Ok. We got to the room. It's falling apart. Mouldy shower, paper coming off walls, dirty warm furniture even etc etc
The pictures show it way better than I could. We wanted to check out. The assistant manager said we could check out but would be charged for one night. I was furious. After some debate (there should have been none) they offered a free night and an upgrade next day. We said ok. The night was the worst night We've had EVER in a hotel, let alone a 5 star. 
The NYE party was supposed to finish at 1.30. It finished nearer to 3. The room was vibrating til then. Literally the bed was vibrating. The hotel should know how to manage for functions. 
This morning, exhausted, we went for breakfast prepared to get the upgrade and make the most of it. 
Breakfast was just crap. 
We were queuing outside the breakfast room with other guests as we'd been asked to do. 
One guest and his family walked straight in, past staff, straight to a table. No-one stopped them. The staff member managing the line said she could not do anything. Another staff member said sometimes there's nothing they can do. They didn't even say anything to the guest. 
We were sent to a table. They said they'd clean it while we selected food. 
The selection not great. 
When we got back to the table they had laid it, it was ""ready"" for us. 
It has food all around it on the floor - see the pics. We were expected to sit and eat breakfast with our feet in other people's food. 
My husband nearly lost it!!
We saw the assistant manager and said we're booking out. There is nothing you can offer that will make this place ok. We had already gone online and booked The Leela. 
The assistant manager (Sanket) agreed to a full refund and organised a hotel driver to take us to the Leela at their cost. That was the best he could do in the circumstances and we appreciate that. 
We are in Goa from 31/12 and leave 05/01. 2 days have been ruined. 
We're knackered!
We're at the Leela now. Much, much better. 
My advice. If you want a real 5 star you cannot go to the Marriott. 
Like I said, we'll be contacting the Marriott Head Office.",0
404,"Recently I visited Marriott to check rooms for my international guests. As i asked the staff to show me certain rooms I was shocked to see staff mopping the floor on their knees. This is never in my wildest dream i expected to see at a hotel chain like Marriott. On inquiry i was told that there are no moppers or mops in the hotel. Does the management know this scandolous situation? Or do they pretend not to know and waited till some guests exposed this. Firstly, this is inhumanitarian, secondly even the cheapest road side guest houses have mops for their housekeeping staff, so for a price charged I am sure Marriott Goa can provide mops to its staff.",0
405,"we have stayed there for 4 nights in November.....we have booked 5 rooms .....accept food everywhere you are in queue , even making reservation it took us 10 days to confirm ...........no reply of emails & no authorized person to talk with ........ every day diff person with diff stories",0
406,"We had a very unpleasant 3 day stay at this hotel last month.
We arrived to scenes of chaos in reception with people all crowded around the reception desks. 
We were allocated a comfortable well appointed standard size room, more like a decent 3 or 4 star standard room.
The first night we were awoken at 4am by shouting guests in the corridors. 
The next morning when staff asked how we were enjoying our stay we happened to politley mention this. We were advised there was a wedding and these things happen.
Breakfast was an absolute disaster each morning. You must stand around for 10 minutes before being allocated a table. Only for said table to be taken by other guests as soon as we got up to get food. No fresh juices were available, and a very poor and confused set up.The biggest problem was the queue's for each and every breakfast station. I waited 10 minutes to use the toaster. When we again politely mentioned this we were told that the hotel is full & nothing was to be done.
When we arrived a wedding was in progress. During the rest of our stay the hotel was preparing for their next weddding.
The preparations began as soon as one wedding finished with builders wandering around the hotel painting the common areas. While laying by the pool a painter came and painted the man hole covers with a green toxic paint at peak time at the pool. The smell was atrocious and many guests complained but the work continued. We had no option but to move away from the pool side as did many other guests.
The stay was not relaxing, and we did not enjoy our time there and would not recommend this hotel.
Panjim is quiet with not a lot to do after dark. We picked this hotel as we wanted to relax and be taken care of by Marriott. After all we this is what we paid for.
In reality breakfast was stressful. We continually kept bumping into work men in the hotel and could not avoid the noise from the function room.
We were very disappointed and felt our feedback was not listened to when we provided it.",0
407,"I stayed at the Goa Marriott hotel from November 18th to the 20st and came away from my stay vowing to never stay at this hotel every again. Not only because of my experience, but because of how I was treated by this hotel and the Marriott brand.

On the 20th, I was approached by an elderly gentleman in the lobby of the Marriott hotel (UK nationality) stating that he had been mugged the night prior, was beaten, and that his passport, wallet, and telephone were all stolen. I immediately let my guard down since I was in the confines of the hotel  what is supposed to be a safe place. The man was well educated, elderly, agitated and seemed to be in very rough shape. Long story short, I helped the individual for over 8 hours in trying to secure him money and a passport (calling supposed relatives overseas; speaking with the UK consulate, etc.) Ultimately, I had a choice. Leave the man with nothing (I had a flight out that day) or try and help him secure a car ride to Delhi  the location of the nearest consulate. I was given details for a money transfer and gave him close to $250. Long story short, no money transfer existed. I was scammed robbed. One could easily say why would you do such a thing? But as a traveler to some very rough places in the world, this was easily the most comprehensive/elaborate ruse I had ever seen. 

Please see details for other individuals conned by the same exact person. This has been going on since 2013 in both Mumbai and Goa. Traditionally it has taken place at the airport or at railway stations. This started in the Marriott hotel -https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowTopic-g304554-i4228-k6752815-Tourist_scam_warning_James_Watson_near_Marine_Drive-Mumbai_Bombay_Maharashtra.html 

Ultimately, this was a crime that originated on the Marriott property in the confines of what is supposed to be a safe place - and note, a 5 star hotel with a $300+ price tag. Ultimately, I requested that Marriott compensate me for the exact amount lost, whether in the form of credit or even a reimbursement for a single night (compared to how much I spend at Marriott/Starwood ever year, this is pennies). This was the least that could be done, as I not only lost a large sum of money but was emotionally shaken by the events. I was given 2,500 points. Anyone who knows Marriott knows that 2,500 couldn't get you a broom closet at the lowest tier hotel.

First, the hotel handled it poorly. They mentioned time and time again that they would call me, to no avail (even after they mentioned theyd file a police report and immediately get back to me, I again received no call). I was eventually told by the hotel, this is a public place, people are free to come and go as they please, we would like to inform you that the hotel will not take any responsibility as the guest was not the resident of the hotel. First, the hotel should be responsible for providing their guest with a safe environment  that is the bottom line. Otherwise what is the difference between this hotel and a hotel in a war zone? And second, Im not sure how guest vs. non guest changes the equation. In fact, I then called Marriott customer service and asked them how I would be treated by Marriott if I were stabbed (no joke, because I was furious at this point and clearly agitated) and the woman told me the outcome would be the exact same. You would have to contact local authorities. 

Im glad the Marriott cares about providing their guests with a safe environment. Please note the heavy sarcasm. This is a company that clearly operates only for financial gain and has no concern for the safety of their guests. Im appalled and frankly saddened that a company would treat a customer this way. There is no sense or morals here. 

I stay at Marriott/Starwood hotels a minimum of 50-60 days a year. And on top of that, my company uses Marriott/Starwood for their bookings. After this, I will make it a point to ensure that is not the case.

KT",0
408,Overall a very bad experience. I was staying for 2 days. The staff is rude and unhelpful. The whole place was managed really terribly during the IFFI event and the manager wasnt even bothered to check the situation. Not sure if i would want to stay here again.,0
409,"We chose Goa Marriott over Taj or Hyatt (Where we are regulars). This hotel does not qualify the 5 stars rating. We were 3 adults and stayed for 3 nights and 4 days at Marriott on Half Board. While it was a mixed feeling of our overall experience, what I would like to bring to Marriot and customers notice is couple of instances at the hotel, which is not what I expected from a 5 star hotel. 

I received a mail just before one day prior to my arrival (less than 24 hours) stating that the Hotel will cancel my reservation if I do not pay within 24 hours since my card declined due to non-availability of enough credit. To remind them, I would state that the Hotel was supposed to charge me a week prior to my arrival. The Hotel didnt charge me so I used that particular card for shopping. I wrote a complaint mail and called the Hotel personally, after that the duty manager bothered to call me for an apology. 

The rooms are not very accommodating for a family with 3 adults, and the property is also not a big one for the price they charge. The lifts are located at quite a distance from the rooms, so one needs to walk a bit. 

In spite of my booking the room more than a month in advance, clearly stating that I will be accompanied by my senior citizen parents, no one bothered to accommodate us with an accessible room. The AC did not work for all the 3 nights and we were perspiring late at night even after maintaining a temperature of 18 degrees. The balcony door never got locked from outside. We called twice for the housekeeping staff to fix it. The guy came and fixed it but the next time, again it never got locked from outside. The hot and cold mixers are terrible in rooms. No one bothered to replenish fruits in the room after turn down service. It is definitely a very worn out property.


I was not comfortable staying in the same room as my senior citizen parents so I went up to reception desk personally twice to request them for another room. I was very coldly told that there is 100% occupancy and I have to pay and make reservation for a separate room. I challenge the Hotel, at any day between my stay, the Hotel was never 100% occupied. I checked it myself on various sites and there were several rooms available. The front staff was least bothered about the problem I was facing staying in 1 room with my senior citizen parents. 

I paid another 36 grand for a separate bay view room for 2 nights. The horror started just after I made a fresh booking. I was informed I will be given a room by 1 pm and I agreed. I personally went to front desk at 2.30 pm. I was made to wait for 10 minutes and then handed over the keys for room no 338, which was an adjoining room with a barely a bay view. In addition to that, there was a dumping place right in front of my room for house keeping staff so there was a continuous disturbance and high volume conversations of the House keeping boys. 

Why there is no one to check the disturbances from all such instances. This is nuisance for the guests who look for noise free and quiet surroundings. 

After spending 2 hours, I called AYS and spoke to Susheel, duty officer requesting him to accommodate me in another room informing about the problems being faced. The duty officer was very rude in his approach and went to the extent of saying it wont be possible. 

I simply lost my temper and reminded him that we are not talking about Hotel giving me a complimentary room. It is about 36 grand which the Hotel charged me for 2 nights. He just kept the phone down saying that he will get back to me. 

Susheel never bothered to call me back so at 6 pm I called back again and reminded AYS of a room change. With reluctance, I was given room no. 244 on 2nd floor. That is the last room on that wing and right in front of the room you can see boarding point for people going on Mandovi cruise. There was disturbance-starting morning till 6 in the evening. I was so tired that day and gave up entirely and settled for whatever I had.


I had paid for a round trip Airport transfer with the package and I was again asked at check out that how would I be making the payment of the vehicle.

Overall Marriott Goa is super sad in terms of service and you have to pay for everything in this hotel. Some instances are as stated.

Reception staff forgot to serve water or welcome drink. Reservations team is very unprofessional & nobody responds on boardline numbers frequently.

I specifically asked for Times of India newspaper while checking in. I believe no one paid attention to what I wrote in the form while checking in.
Service at Waterfront Caf is even more horrible. The major chaos is breakfast time, which on all 3 days was a big let down. During our stay the food was not refilled and only when we questioned, they were sorry about it. The boys at Waterfront caf are more interested in chit chatting than customer service.
The food is not refilled very often and customers are kept waiting. The taste and options are not great and are repetitive. The coffee/tea came only after reminders and was never hot. Egg section is absolutely a mess and so is tea/coffee. No butter or ketchup on tables.
I was charged for a simple Fresh lime soda while having dinner. The beverages are not included in dinner is what was informed. Awful. 
Fruits not replenished in the rooms.
Housekeeping not attentive.
Beach is not clean or well maintained.
Below average SPA and sheer waste of money.
Casino is chargeable, it came as a surprise to me. Paid 1 grand for each person.
No farewell cake or pastry on the last day.


Overall not at all recommended, super bad experience with such a high cost. Least expected from Marriott.",0
410,"This was the worst experience of mine with Goa Marriott.

Torn table mats laid for guests, bisleri cartoons scattered all over the coffeeshop, my jeans which went for dry cleaning on my check in came damaged and accepted by the management, elevators from the lobby to the coffeeshop not functional for past 20 days and Hindus please be carefully as they tag their buffet wrong most often and that happened to me again this visit. They tagged pork sausages as chicken sausages. I as a HINDU BRAHMIN am not allowed or ever touched pork n beef in the past 40 years. Pl make sure what you are eating. Look at the pictures for you reference.

412,"We were in Goa for the weekend and decided to have lunch at the Marriott. After travelling all the way from North Goa where we were staying, we arrived at the restaurant which was a mess (not even half full). Nobody to acknowledge or assist, we walked around looking for a table. We had to literally attract the attention of colleagues to confirm whether we could sit in a particular section. When we requested for the A la carte menu, as we had a late breakfast, we were told that we have to go for the Brunch only and a la carte won't be served. It was a rude shock as not everyone would like the Brunch spread or have the appetite to eat that much. The response was mechanical, the staff looked confused and in rush. A simple apology with a smile would have been sufficient.",0
413,"Worst experience ever..
The staff here is pathetic..
In the restaurant , we ordered for a chicken burger which was just horrible and left it as it is , later we ordered for a cold coffee ..in the name of cold coffee we were served a better drink which was horrible..
The staff were not at all attentive 
To place one order I had to search for a boy for like 15min..
On complaining the restaurant manager Mr.Brinston had no manners at all to speak to a lady..
Instead of asking us about our issue ,he was fighting with us ..
This is so disappointing..
Finally when we asked for bill, we were charged double..
Marriott Resort has such good reputation worldwide but this one proved to be really miserable..
I am never ever gonna book with this property again..
I was recommended this hotel but I will make sure people know the fact about this property..
Please respect woman !",0
414,"The rooms have a good view of the bay but it is always occupied with local cheap tourist boats that play loud music. And we found cockroaches crawling freely on the buffet table everyday for three days and once in the salad in room service. A international cricket team was staying along side and we bit our tongues..plus the managers hovered over us to not make a ruckus but seriously kitchen is swarming with the roaches....STAY AWAY

415,"Rude staff especially front desk, resturant, except a few in the conference room.

416,"I had booked the hotel on 27th Dec 2015 and received a confirmation too from the hotel with my booking confirmation number, I travelled all the way from Jaipur to Goa and on reaching the hotel they tell my they cancelled my booking, I was totally shocked and upset for no reason they cancelled my booking, thy told me on 18th Jan 2016 they mailed my regarding my cancellation, once you receive a booking confirmation and plan your trip who will ever think that in the end moment the hotel will cancel your stay just because they had a system error and thy couldn't use my card.

If this was the problem that same day you should have mailed me when I booked or the same week. How can u cancel my booking just 4 days before my arrival, that too with just a mail. Goa has net issues I couldn't even read my mail on the 18th I was in Goa then for a wedding. #marriott this is not expected from a 5 star property like you. You should have either informed me well in advance so that I could look for a diff hotel, you take the customers phone number, why didn't I receive a call bout my cancellation or the card not working.

Me being a female I had to roam all night alone to look for a hotel and that was a peak time in Goa all decent hotel properties were sold out and all that was available was oyo rooms. 

#marriott you just spoiled my trip.

They person sitting on the front desk did not help and just said we are sold out. Pathetic. And on top this you have no direct number to your hotel. Whenever I called it wouldn't connect to some other country and they wouldn't understand my English language accent. Do something about your services. And atleast with a female you cannot be so non cooperative. 
BAD EXPERIENCE in terms of your staff, booking process. #marriottgoaresort",0
417,I have never been to a hotel that is rated a 5* to have had experienced such bad kept rooms. The bathroom had mould around the sides...the glass window between the bedroom and bathroom had hand marks on them....there was mould around the sink....the shower head broke off as soon as I went to lift it to shower...the view from the room was of broken slates...the fruit left as complimentary was old as if it was left there for a few days....the iron did not work and having complained about this it was still not replaced....the wifi went down for a long period of time that I had to go to another hotel to use their wifi and decided to have dinner there aswell....i found the buffet selection boring too....after experiencing what me and my partner experienced having checked in for our honeymoon we asked for a refund....we are still waiting for this and I do hope I get this soon....I do not recommend this hotel its not worth the money...,0
418,"I have booked a 2 night stay at Marriott resort and Spa Goa viz 29 Jun and 30 Jun. The experience of booking so far has been a traumatic experience wasting almost 6 hours of my time speaking to various executives and getting contradicting statements and rates from 5 executives i am dreading what they are going to finally charge me and what kind of experience i will finally have.
The first day i spoke to Vivek at Goa marriot who gave me a deal of Rs13200 incl taxes per night for 2 adults and 2 kids with breakfast and dinner. This whole coversation almost took about 40 minutes because of the long wait and being put on hold many times after getting the marriott number with great difficulty.
Since it was so difficult to contact Goa Marriott I called at the centralised Marriott number given by Vivek and was put through to Mr ISAAC who gave me a rate of Rs 12250 for the same . When I told him to cross check as the rate quoted by Vivek was higher and kids were accompanying me he said that this was the present rate hence i gave him my credit card details and he sent me a confirmation mail with the booking number as 90380143 in the name of Amar
As i noticed in the confirmation mail that the breakfast and dinner for kids had not been mentioned I called centralised reservation again and spoke to Mr ISAAC again who flatly denied that the rate included my kids whereas i had specially asked him the first time. He then recalculated the rate and told me the rate including kids breakfast and dinner would be Rs 13000. I then requested him to send a confirmation mail and I got 3 copies of the original mail quoting Rs 12250 for 2 adults b'fast and dinner. 
The next day feeling harrassed I made another call and spoke to Ms Shruti and told her that i was totally confused and upset and told her to check the recored message of my conversations.
She was very helpful but quoted a rate of Rs13357 for the same. While I was speaking to Shruti i got a mail from Ms Evanessa Lyngdoh asking me for my credit card detaiuls and surprisingly also asking me as to which marriott hotel i wanted to stay in. Expressing my surprise to Shruti I told her the same and she apologized and said she would send me a confirmation mail about the rate she had just quoted.
Still being naive I thought the matter had finally settled but to my surprise I recieved another mail from Ms Evanessa Lyngdoh who quoted me a rate of Rs 13577 for the same deal.
Disgusted I called Marriott Goa and completed the circle by speaking to Abhishek who said that i would finally be charged Rs 13400.

I must say this has been a very harrowing experience for me so far from Marriott Goa which is rated Number 2 of Goa resorts on your site which is one of the main reasons I booked here but I feel you need to really look into their booking system, and it gives such a POOR impression of the hotel even before check in. Now i am actually wary of what deal Im going to get at check in and am giving second thoughts to weather I should stay in a property which claims to be a 5 star resort but with extremely poor operations",0
419,"This is not a 5 star property! I normally dont write reviews but this place was just too terrible! 
-The pool and lounge area are dirty and everywhere smells like fungus. 
-We found a huge cockroach in our bathroom (picture available!) and hotel staff thought its not a big deal!
- We had to wait for a table for breakfast for around 15 minutes. Ordered eggs and had to wait another 30 minutes and thsn just when we finished they asked us to leave the restaurant cause they needed to get ready for brunch! 
Overall the only nice thing about this hotel is its lobby! Nothing else is appealing.",0
420,"We have just spent two weeks at The Marriott,Goa and apart from the staff being wonderful I can't think of another good thing to say! It has very small grounds so the pool, pool bar and restaurant area are squashed up together. They have wedding after wedding and conference people in between so in the 14 days we can't remember a quiet day. Added to this a fleet of up to 12 small people carrying boats continually stop as close to the shore as possible playing very loud music, the crew and passengers shout and the boat engine are revved up constantly. They bring passengers from the town across to the beach at the front of the hotel and seem to delight in annoying the guests. The shore is only a few feet away from the pool area so there is no escaping them! If you have your balcony door open the fumes from the boat engines even come into the room. My husband joked that the only quiet place was in the lift on our own with the door closed! I can only assume that the rave reviews on this website are either written by people who are not used to peace and tranquility or are relations of the owners! Their website promises relaxation and rejuvenation, all we got was constant noise and aggravation! Why are hotels in Goa allowed to get away with this sort of advertisement without saying that they host lots of weddings and conferences which dominate everything?",0
421,One should never arrange any conference in this hotel your business will suffer they serve stale food and have absolute amateur staff to manage your important event. On top of this they have courage to ask why we did not complain on time. Non cooperation at its best,0

Even i lost my phone charger nd power bank from the room itself nd thr was no response from hotel staff.food qualityvwas good ..................................................",0
423,"This is the first time I came to Marriott Goa. I came for a conference here and was excited to stay at their property. Excitement turned to disappointment the moment I reached. I left the bag at the conceirge to register for the conference and get my room key. When I come back, my bag is nowhere to be seen. The guys at the conceirge are looking dumbstruck and questioning each other. I was told by one of them to give them my room number and theyd deliver it there. I went back the room, waited for 30 min, nothing came. Then I went back to the reception / conceirge, and my bag was lying there and no one was bothered. So then I asked one of the guys to deliver it to the room and finally it was there. 
Another instance of disappointment: id set up a wake up call at 7. And this wwad perfectly executed by the staff, only to make me irritated. I received 3 calls 1 minute apart asking me to wake up. I couldnt resist, and I had to snap at the lady calling me. No apologies done!
Another small instance, I wake up at every hotel expectinf the days newspaper to be kept out. Here I found none.
To top up all the disappointment (as if there was less earlier), I was seated for breakfast just about to start my meal. And this person comes and tells me, sit somewhere else... dude! You never ask someone to get up while their eating.. table manners 101!!
The only silver lining at a really horrible service, was the lady at breakfast who apologized and was very pleasant. Also the AC in the room stopped working the previous night and so the repair guys did a fantastic job. The only people whom I really felt nice speaking to was them. Rest all are fakely nice.. just on the outside, they dont reallly care.
I was planning on extending my stay, but clearly that wont happen ever at the Marriott Goa!!
I think just because I was a conference guest I was treated this way.",0
424,"We found out after we checked in that this hotel is by a river. The Mondovi River to be exact. No where close to the ocean. Felt ripped off. The person who checked us in had the nerve to ask us if we wanted to pay 8000 rupees per day and update to a oceanfront room. My husband said "" what oceanfront"". Resturant staff are super slow. I had ordered coffee well i got that half hr later but no teaspoon. I had to ask 3 different people until i got one. Very disappointed at this place. Never staying here again",0

This hotel drops way below the standards we'd come to expect so much so that we spent the first day researching and visiting alternatives. The staff are very pleasant and eager to help but the food is poor quality. The carpets and wall covering in the walkways are filthy. The shopping complex only has a few occupants the rest are bare shells littered with mess and plate glass windows allow you to see all. The thumping sond track in the well equipped gym may not be to all tastes but certainly destroys any attempt at ambience in the spa directly below.

When the barman realized that i was checking the same , he refilled it back in the bottle & bought absoulte from other outlet... well there was no absolute in the waterfront cafe itself. When the issue was bought to managers notice, they created a story of Ketel One vodka being ordered from & then getting cancelled & refilling it in the bottle again. ..

Please check & verify what you are ordering for & what you are getting served in the glass.",0
427,"My friend and I decided to spend the night as I had a voucher (Marriott preferred) and it was woman's day. Moreover , my friend was visiting me from the US after 4 yrs.

Service has exponentially decreased .....that is the tip of the iceberg!! Last night, there was a puddle of water from the ac (our good luck ..that nobody slipped!) and the ac went off!!! and Goa was indeed v hot yesterday. The only compensation that they can think of...is a complimentary dinner!!!

Our room was dusty when we checked in and the dust was obvious on the dark wooded furniture. The corridor smelt nicer than the room which was so musty.......would not recommend this place unless as a last resort (pun intened).

The quality as well as spread of food at waterfront has been slowly but surely declining.....perhaps comments may be encouraging from first timers or unexposed clentele...but the experienced traveller too should be considered.Service too is on the decline except for the restaurant manager who seemed professional and just a couple of service guys were up to the mark. We are also Marriott rewards members....one being silver!

Stay there ONLY if you must.....but dine in the neighbourhood...Goa has excellent food in it's moderate and smaller joints!",0
428,"We have been staying at this hotel for last more than 2 years and have stayed for more than 20 times atleast!!! However this time (in December, 2012) the experience was rather terrible :-( the management was pathetic under the manager-ship of Sanket, who didn't have the courtesy of attending their regular customers if they had some trouble with the services of the hotel staff! The baggage management was pathetic and needs improvement... The earlier management was fantastic though!!! They really need to take care of their services else they will loose their customers. The location of course is fantastic especially their bay view patio rooms!!!",0
429,"The Marriot is a lovely hotel, no doubt about it. The interior restaurants do good food and the buffet deal is very reasonable. However, last night I visited the 'seafood festival' for dinner. It was a horrible experience in all. Put at a table which was in total darkness 'the other tables with lights are booked'. Had to repeatedly ask for a menu and they brought a torch for us to read it. Kept pushing the wine menu at us. Waiters seemed harassed although gathered together in a group for most of the time. The food was truely awful, wrong sauces, wrong orders, wrong quantities and a superior, weary attitude. I don't believe that these staff have ever seen the inside of a training school. The staff inside are quite the opposite. The Mai Tai I ordered was a joke, something my child might make when playing pretend. Whoever runs this festival, management need to be aware how dire it is. I will certainly not return. However the malaysian festivel will start soon and as it is inside, I look forward to it.",0
430,"Just spent 1 night in august 2012, instead of 3 initially booked: we left immediately after 1st horrible night, and hopefully saved our holidays.

Negative points:
Room is not corresponding to Booking description and our request of a quiet non smelling room with sea view. Management instead of respecting it, tried to sell us an upgrade. Strong smelling fungus in all the bedrooms, of cigarette smokes in bed sheets. 
Window joints missing, glass door of the shower cab collapsed in the hands of our child hurting her. Safety box was blocked after we put our stuff. Extra bed was only a thin layered mattress uncomfortable.
The breakfast buffet included in tariff is a shame in term of quality and variety, not better than in a factory canteen, salad bar is a ridiculous pitiable choice of green peas and corn to assemble, no seafood while just in front of ocean.

Positive point:
We see only one good point; a nice location along miramar beach, at junction between river and sea, in Panaji, the main city of Goa, 45 min from airport. 

Globally this Mariott hotel is a scam for the price we paid of 13,000 INR for one night, Management was only able to ask is if we enjoyed without even inderstanding their errors, or offering us a price reduction.
We switched immediately to Taj Vivanta with a formula including dinner to spend our 2 last nights and saved 150 USD.",0
431,"The food is terrible and the service is worse. Having stayed at other hotels in India, we were used to good food and service. This hotel was shocking. They couldn't care less. The beaches are dirty and smelly. I think its best you avoid Goa altogether. I think there are much better beaches and hotels in the East than here. Trust me- I have been around if you must know",0
432,"Before I start the review proper, I want to state that I did not actually stay at the hotel, but was eagerly planning my wedding reception there - for all the same reasons people choose to stay there; renowned Marriott brand, 5 star atmosphere that will impress guests...location in Panjim...etc

I met up personally with the events management personnel of Marriott Goa, to discuss the reception, well in advance (1 yr in advance to be exact). So time constraints, surely was not an issue. These people, on behalf of Marriott Goa, promised to send us details including quotations, menu options etc and very eagerly took down our correspondence details. My family waited patiently for 2 months before flying down to Goa again to check on the progress Marriott events team had made. Another personal visit and we were told that an email had been sent and had probably gotten lost in the world wide web (outright lies obviously). We would like to remind the Marriott staff that they couldve looked at the business card provided to them and perhaps tried confirming via phone - something that better trained staff in other organizations would have done. 

To pacify us, an email was sent on the day of the second visit to explain that the said personnel's 'system was down' (whatever that was supposed to mean..since an email did come out of it) and she would get back to us ASAP....and then......silence for a couple of months more...I sent another email requesting for an update, not to one but to two members of the Marriott Goa team...and still, no reply!

What is the reason for this ridiculous behavior? Granted the hotels core business in not hosting receptions but we did want to put up our guests in the rooms. Perhaps we did not have the right approach? Honestly, short of signing a blank check, I was willing to compromise on a lot of the requirementsbut heck, at least let me know what I am buying..and how long does it take for any professional body to churn out a quotation?!?! Bah..forget a quotation, just a matter of setting up proper communications for an event..Humbug!

Well thankfully I have found a venue and management staff that actually seem interested in running a business and while they do not profess to be 5 Star, their service has proven to be far better than the internationally renowned..My only grouse now is that Marriott shouldnt have wasted my time....If you do not want to do it and/or do not have the capacity to do it, just say that you are fully booked.",0
433,"If you want to have a good night sleep this is not the place for you! The walls are very thin, so you can hear people walking and talking in the corridors at night and in the early morning. 
The bathroom is disgusting.. And the whole room and the corridors have a bad smell! 

Stay away from the food in the buffet! The food is cold and old. 

Every night you can hear nois from partyboats.. :/ 
I recommend staying at Leela Kempinski! You get sooo much for the money! And you get a nice beach as well.",0
434,"We stayed here for Christmas 08- it was one of the worst experiences i have ever had at a hotel (i forgot to write a review at the time but was reminded to because thinking of going away this Christmas and agent recommended a Marriot hotel in Eygpt). We booked in on Christmas Eve (stupidly having moved from the Leela to be close to my wife's relatives at Christmas) and the room we were given was appalling- beside some sort of ventilator system for hotel (outside of the window) and the room was dusty and mildewed. At the time our son was 4 months old and was with us and asked to be moved room and for the inconvenience we obviously caused them they gave us the privilege of waiting for close to 8 hours for our 'new' room, which with a 4 month chid is not ideal as you can imagine. When they placed us in a room it that was only very marginally better- i managed to get a chest infection from the air conditioning in the dark dank room they placed me in which took me two weeks to recover from . Essentially they ruined Christmas Eve for us (because we did not get into our room until after 10 pm and restaurants were closing at that time) and my Christmas because i got a chest infection from the horrible room they placed us in. The hotel given the time of year was very busy, understaffed but with a staff that generally could not have given a monkeys about the guests (well us anyway). I would avoid like the plague- the facilities were very average, there is not much in Panji (for tourists anyway) and it is very overpriced for what it proclaims to be. Go to the Leela or one of the Taj's for a 5 star hotel.",0
435,"It was better when Rajiv Seth was GM, i had parties and well organized.

Then on my 40th birthday i had a dinner party in Chinese restaurant on 7th July 2007, inspite setting menus one week ahead for 40 pax, with the chef and inspite of reminders 1 day ahead. They couldnt manage it.

They messed up my party that you can ever imagine, service was too slow, and can you imagine they made a small 2 kg cake for 40 pax ...A real laughing stock, they gave me discount of the mess they created plus a free lunch or dinner at Marriots Goa, but after this incident i have never again stepped in Marriots.",0
436,"rude arrogant and very helpless staff, need serious training to get to the standard of Marriot. Had to wait 20 mins to get a drink.

437,"What you see is what you believe. The website of this hotel builds of the stay superbly well, but once you reach the property do you realise how hollow the promises are. First of all, this hotel does NOT have a private beach. It overlooks the river and to get a taste of the goan sea, you will have to walk down 5-7 minutes to a near public beach. The check in process took us more than a hour. No not because there was a long que or somethin, just that they did not have the rooms ready. We were asked to use the casino in the mean time to while away our time, but the gentleman in the casino would no allow us as we had technically not checked in as yet. He failed to understand that there was a delay from the management's end in checking us in. We were not even allowed inside the casino. After waiting for an hour, when we finally got our room, the room itself was a disappointment. All in all, it was not way close to what you expect of a Mariott property. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED!",0
438,"This was our second stay at this hotel and we must say this hotel has gone from ok (that it was 2 years back) to bad (now). We hear that the last time rooms in this hotel underwent any makeover was more than 6 years back. So, your chances of finding anything new or clean is pretty low. We would rate the hotel to be not even worth a two-star. Given its location and the size, the hotel could have been the top in its class but the poor maintenance has brought it down to pits.

Pick-up from the airport was flawless. It was a shared shuttle and there was some wait involved at the airport but overall it was handled smoothly

Check-in at the hotel is extremely slow. It took forever to have someone attend to us after we arrived. And, even after it was initiated, it seemed like the person had to do a lot of paperwork behind the counter. I couldn't see what he was doing but he seemed to be updating lots of records.

The first room we were given was extremely dirty with rusted shower panels, greasy look on the floor. This, after we had an explicit mail exchange with the reservation staff a priory that we were fussy about the cleanliness because of our child who tends to run around the floor without his slippers. When we complained, we were promptly offered to have a look at the other rooms. We were shown two rooms - none of which were up to our expectations. We offered to come down from bay view room to a garden view room if there were cleaner room available on that side and were asked to wait until they checked it out. It was a long wait and we decided to take our dinner first even before getting a moments rest after we arrived. Post dinner we were shown a garden view room which was even worse - it had seepage on the wall facing the bathroom. What was even more annoying was that the lady at the front desk had the guts to pass the blame for the poor maintenance on the ""mositure in the Goa air"". We had no more patience to fight and compromised on a room that was far below our expectations. See the attached pictures of this room with grasy floor, cracked walls etc. To make matters worse, we noticed that the mini bar had an open Pepsi can with tissues pumped in. Not sure if it was a ploy to overcharge us or just pure carelessness at ensuring a clean mini-bar after the previous guests left.

When we woke up the other day, we traced out the house keeping in-
charge and requested him to point us to a decent room. He indeed turned out to be a person who knew his job. He took us to one of the cleanest rooms in the hotel and we at last shifted to a room worth staying.

Buffet at the hotel was ok with ample choice of Continental and Indian food but the menu was almost the same every day. As a free gift from the chef, you are likely to find hair in the food. We saw other guests complaining about this too. Speaks a lot for the cleanliness standards at the hotel!

The Glimpses of Goa tour that the hotel offers is avoidable. The guide who took us around was good and knew his job. However, it is too short a tour with only 2 places covered in the whole tour. You would be better off spending this time at a beach or lazing around in the pool.

Overall the only things worth some praise at the hotel are a) the staff - they are courteous and prompt and b) the bar at the pool-side.

Beware of the attempts to overcharge you when you check out. Invariably, you will find that you are being charged for something you never availed of. It happened to us during our last trip and it happened again this time. Seems too much to be a coincidence! Each time however they reversed it promptly without any argument, claiming that it was a mistake.

In summary, avoid this hotel. There are many more properties in Goa that would be worth your hard earned money.

439,"The service that I'd received in this hotel was very poor. This was sad given that the rooms and facilities were reasonable.

I had paid to stay at the Executive Floor, and below are my encounters:

When checking in, I gave my credit card per request to cover for additional charges during my stay. The front desk took my card, talked to my male friend through the welcome speech and returned my card to my male friend all the time that I was there!

When I ordered food/ drinks at the Executive lounge, they do not take my orders unless the order was given to them by my male friend. This extends to request for straws, napkins, etc. 

Staff at the the Executive Lounge kept asking me for my room number (to the extent of 4 times in 10 mins) throughout my stay there. I heard them questioning if I should even be there! This treatment did not extend to my male friend who was with me. It is unacceptable that I still get this treatment 5 consective times after I'd been to the Lounge.

I noticed this service attitude did not extend to the fairer sex of other nationalities (there were caucasians and indian nationals during the 1 week stay that I was there).

I paid the hotel's car service cash for a trip to the town. Staff returned with the change and handed it straight to my male friend.

This hotel experience definitely spoilt my holiday. Totally not recommended at all.

Somehow they forgot to clean the toilets and they still had odors fro the last guest (I assume).
Then we went to the swimming pool and the 'Resort' part of the hotel. A very small swimming pool in front of a very small, not very clean, beach entertains the patrons.

The staff is OK. And the amenities are a little antiquated but they are always renovating them.

442,"I stayed at the hotel for four nights in the last week of October 2008 i.e. at the start of the 2008-09 season. The property is in a great location for a business traveller but sadly it is not a five star hotel. It needs a major upgrade and lacks consistent standards on food, food delivery, service delivery and customer service. The spa is very old and shabby with dust accumulating on the walls. The steam room has the words in an ""in an emergency -pull stop"" painted by hand directly on to the wall in a similar fashion to signs painted in Indian Railway compartments. The bathrooms in the rooms themselves are old, have plastic toilet seats, sharp edges and pinch risks and generally need an upgrade. 
Cutlery used is variable in that one will find a fork of one design and a knife of another and a spoon of a third. Room service trays will vary from one day to the next in terms of condiments and tray settings. I ordered a club sandwich and I was asked, would I like the bread ""roasted"" or plain? I said, toasted would be fine. I get a call a few minutes later from a very enthusiastic person ""Sir, I would like to grill the bread for you, you would like it, let me grill it just a little."" I said go ahead and grill it. Well it arrived with the bread ""grilled a little"". It was soft with just the grill marks to show and came with undercooked fries. I had no idea that a club sandwich could be the subject of such mystery and confusion. 
Buffet breakfast is offered with a large variety but sadly a lack of standards pervails. The sambhar in the Indian section was over salted, the egg counter chef needed three goes to get fried eggs ""over easy"" done. The mixed cutlery pervades the restaurants as well. 
The executive lounge has families with young kids using it as well. So having a business meeting there may not have the hushed atmosphere you might like. 
The hotel does not have a concierge, it has a ""taxi counter"" whose function is not to get you a taxi but to offer a hotel car at exhorbitant rates. When I asked for local taxi rates I was told that they had no idea. You get the drift, ""rip off"" the tourist.
All in all, disappointing for a Marriott and not value for the exhorbitant 200 dollars per night for what is essentially a 4 star locally run hotel.

443,"Pretty OK hotel. The serivce should be worked upon. Calls to room service or requests to the reception sometimes had to be made twice/thrice or were answered really late.
The hotels location is superb when going around is concerned but not a beach hotel. The BEACH IS SAD.
The food is pretty good. Infact i would rate it 9/10.
The bathrooms are really small (atleast in the room i was in) but pretty well organised. The aromatherpy things in the shower are worth checking out, truly relaxing stuff.
The pool is SAD too, its very small for a resort hotel, for people who like to swin its real dissapointment (Max Depth is 4ft) and so is the pool bar. The outdoor showers are something that should be removed from the website. Its only for bikini shoots.
Request all to not go by the pictures on the website, very misleading. 
The hotels tennis court is/was in terribly state. 
The hotel has everything in it except a beach, but the everything that it seems to have, looks like it has been stuffed in. The Small Pool, The Pool Bar (In a Small Pool), Just One Major Restaurant, Really Small Casino (Please dont enter with women, this place is strictly for guys).
We went to other hotels for dinner etc and found out some better hotels had the SAME prices, so i would suggest you people to take a good long look at the options.
I would suggest this hotel only and only if you have a really good deal, cause there is no beach the hotel offers, IN GOA. 
I am surely not staying at this hotel, more cause there are better hotels offering better/same deals with good beaches. And thats what we want in Goa.

444,"This was our third visit to the Goa Marriott and will probably be our last. Our first visit was in 2005 when it was amazing and it seems now that the hotel needs a bit of a ""tidy up"" and some areas are looking distinctly tired. Room was very clean as always but the bathroom, specifically the bath and tiling were in need of updating. Paintwork on the outside of the hotel in some areas was very poor. Our room was on the top floor, sea facing (amazing view) next to the tennis courts. This part of the hotel is looking very untidy and I discarded the photographs I took of the room from the gardens, I was too embarrassed to show them to friends. I was extremely sad to see the ""net"" over the outside dining area. I know it was there to keep the birds away from the food but it looked like it was just cobbled together, really spoilt the look of the hotel. 

On the plus side, staff were, as ever, very helpful and all my moaning aside, we had a relaxing vacation. 

As our last visits have always been over the Christmas/New Year period we had not experienced the hotel when full of business people. This time we visited in February and really did not enjoy being oggled by business people (mostly men) when relaxing on the sunbeds. I would advise to definately check to see if there are conventions on when visiting the hotel.

Must mention the Cake Shop - it is absolutely brilliant. The cakes are amazing.

445,"Starting from the best aspects of the hotel and working down: the hotel itself has great service, good food, nice gym, decent spa, older style rooms that are clean, but the hotel is in a TERRIBLE location. The hotel is essentially in the middle of nowhere and you need a taxi or motorbike to get anywhere off the property - 20 miles to anything fun. Sadly the beaches around this hotel are some of the dirtiest I have ever seen (see pictures 50 yards from hotel). They make an effort to keep things somewhat clean directly around the hotel but beyond 50 yards itts horrible. In addition there is nothing to do/eat or see within walking distance of the hotel. I was a bit confused why Frommers touts this as a great location when it is in the ""middle of nowhere"" I took a taxi and drove all around and for my money the Fort Aguada Beach Resort would have been the best location. Although I did not go inside it clearly had a better/cleaner beach and within a short way from an actual village with restaurants/shopping, attractions and night life. I am American and I travel a lot for business in Asia, and should have folowed by normal instincts and not stay at an American Chain while in Asia/India (Four Seasons does not count since its Canadian and they do have wonderful properties in Asia) Fort Aguada Beach is run by Taj Group which is an Indian company managing high end properties.

446,"I booked this because of the previous reviews - but we were really disappointed. Of course, it's about what you expect - so the Marriott may be suitable for some - not for us.
Overall, this is a rather noisy conference and package tourist hotel with ok service in a remote location.

Let's start with the good things:
Service is very friendly. People are nice. It's located directly at the channel (not the sea!) so you always have a nice breeze. Breakfast ist really stunning. A huge variety and high quality - throughout. The spa is nice as well. The hotel has a good standard (somewhere around 4 Star with some 5 star features). 

Here is what we did not like:
The hotel campus is rather small with just a 6-10 meter stretch of grass/pool between the wall at beach and the hotel itself. Within this rather small campus, all guests, the pool as well as restaurants try to find space - so it has a rather crowded feel. About half of the guests are UK package tourists and teh remainder 1-2 day conference guests, meaning there is lots of checking in and out all day. The hotel put's itself into the entertainment category. During dinner, there is always rather loud live music (african, 60's or a mix of both) playing. Given the small campus, it's hard to escape. In addition, we had large garden parties for the conference guests in the remainder of the garden for 4 out of 7 nights with own live music and buffet. So conversation during dinner is a real challenge. Luckily, our room was in the wing without garden so we could at least sleep - but our friends had the ""party garden side"" and were less lucky. To make things worse, the large discotheque on reception level operates twice a week. The lack of sound insulation means you get full sound from two sides during some dinners. Again, some may like this - for us it was hell. The building is the typical Marriott with US-style hallways and the normal amenities (could be anywhere in the world - few Indian touches). As to the service, it was ok but far from consistent. The mini-bar refill happened only twice in a week. Some appliances were broken and took days to get fixed. The room service did refill shampoo one day - not the other day, etc. Nothing major and well made up for by the friendly staff.

If it would have been less noisy and intimidating, we would have forgiven the details - but this was one week of unwanted ""party"" and not relaxing at all.

So if you enjoy entertainment and fun and do not normally spend time in 5* hotels, you will like this place. If you prefer intimacy or romance or local touches, stay away.

447,"Advertised as luxury 5 star, but more like a poor 4 star. No beach, smell from water wafting around, pool is more akin to a large paddling pool than a 5 star hotel swimming pool, room in poor condition, bad food, warm beer, poor air-conditioning, generally poor service.

If you go, then the best rooms are the suites.

NB. The hotel at least has good toilets which you will come to appreciate after a few days.

450,"We just stayed for 3 nights in February 2013. We were two couples essentially with our rooms being as far as almost 1.2 a km from each other :( distributed over two wings and one needs to take different lifts for different levels and a little walk to reach each other. Rooms are nice but balconies crammed up for space. One of the queen beds of the two in each room had a broken mattress that can cause one immense back ache by the time one wakes up early in the morning. Service is average with beverages (aerated drinks/sodas) being not only very expressive but ridiculouslycharged differently when taken from minibar or ordered from different sections of hotel. Complimentary Breakfast was nice and sumptuous but there seem to be lot of confusion among the zealous waiters. Swimming Pool although ""infinity"" do not necessarily give you that feeling and perhaps should have been raised a bit. Jacuzzi at the pool was non functional. There is no beach where one can take a walk and dip in the waters, apparently its on riverfront and not sea front. Our room was on the right wing facing the river with adjoining lawn hosting wedding parties and receptions causing avoidable disturbance and noise through out the day thereby encroaching upon the privacy so desired in a 5 star property. Normally most 5 star hotels have the party-area away from the main rooms. Located far away from the happening area of Calangute-Bagha-Anjua and Morjim, one would certainly need a car to be able to move around Goa from here. Just because our rooms were sponsored and hence free for us, we did not mind staying here but i wont like to pay and stay here.",0

452,"Goa Marriott is always my second home. Been visiting the place for almost 6 years now. Used to love the way you are treated there. But recently i heard that the things are not great there. Until i landed there myself to get a first hand experience...

plus points - great place to relax, awesome view for the river, nicely renovated rooms, 

minus points - customer care is bad, no proper person to guide you, the telephone operator messes up your calls big time, staff at the restaurant are rude, breakfast menu is complete cut down version( far far below standard) .. all these experience put you off big time. It actually can ruin your great holiday. 

Looks the staff is new and inexperienced. 

So if you are to going to take room service or eat at the resort , and just want to stay there... then go ahead. 

But i need to mention a few people who really tried to go out of their way to sort things out..
1. The GM of Marriotts who upgraded my room after a week of haggling to confrm my booking with the privilage members section
2. Delilah of front office who called to find if everything was okay.
3. Ashwani Kumar , Assistant manager -concierge, who actually reimbursed my breakfast bill for a lousy rude attitude of the staff.

There are some good people at the resort who can go out of their way to help your stay a pleasent on, but the majority are just rude.",0
453,"I booked a 5 night stay here over park Hyatt as this got slightly better reviews (only marginally).

However, this is NOT a 5 star property, at best it is an average 4 star property. The word ""resort"" is also slightly misleading as the property is quite small with what can only be described as a decent size childrens pool.

So the positives, airport transfers were on time and communications were good prior to booking. The check in was smooth too and the cleaners do a good job on a daily basis. The gym was pretty good too.

The negatives:

Breakfast and dinner - we booked half board (which I wouldn't recommend). Breakfast was ok but the food for dinner was very poor. I would've expected that the Indian section would at least be decent but it wasn't, it was mostly bland with hardly any flavour. 

The ""waterfront restaurant"" is more like a cafeteria with very poor ambience. Service was hit and miss too, ordering eggs and tea for breakfast took over half an hour on the 2 mornings they actually got it right. The other 2 mornings, what we ordered never arrived after waiting for 40 mins so we just left.

Although we had half board, we had dinner at local restaurants on most nights which was 10 x better.

Staff - on the whole were pleasant to deal with. Urmilla our cleaner did a great job with our room every day.

One thing I didn't appreciate is the kickbacks the hotel receives from the cab companies. The 2 occasions we asked the hotel to call us cabs, the prices were hugely inflated and they insisted we pay the hotel staff the fare instead of the driver. 

We took a cab to one of the markets by hailing it ourselves, cost - 150 INR. Asked the hotel the following day at roughly the same time, cost - 300 INR. Appreciate there may be an admin fee for picking up the phone but double the fare ??

Same with airport transfers upon departure, asked for a Normal cab, cost - 1500 INR. Asked the drivers how much they usually charge, they said 800 to 1000 INR max. Again had to pay the staff directly rather than cab driver. 

I am a Marriott reward member and thought these types of practices were above Marriott but this ""resort"" showed a real lack of class. Definitely not what I expect considering I paid circa 250 per night.

In conclusion, the resort kind of reminded me of the places I used to stay when I would go on cheap holidays in my teens with friends! Definitely not 5 star and I'm really surprised by the amount of positive reviews.

If you want 5 star/luxury, this is definitely not the place!!",0
454,"I was expecting a relaxed holiday at the Marriott Goa Panjim, so have made some the reservation given my requirements. I had email and even had a call to confirm that the room should near the elevator as I am traveling with a Sr.citizen who can walk much, It was confirmed that We would get a room as per my requirements. However when i reach the hotel, I got a room away from the elevator. We asked them that we had requested for room near the elevator, however the front desk informed that it was a the closest room to the elevator that was available, after confronting with the front desk that our prerequisite was for the room near the elevator which I was assured by the hotel, we were given a rooms near the elevator the next day. 
The house keeping staff was prompt to our request and theydo a good job to keep the hotel clean. However the bathroom tiles had mold and that was the case in both the room. the bath tub hand shower were leaking which spilled the water out of the tub. In the elevator there is a wooden handle missing and the screw/nails jutting out of the wood, luckily one us escaped with a minor scratch, however these thing should taken care of. You don't expect such thing for in 5 star room where you are paying around $1000 for 3 nights. I have stayed at the other Marriotts before and even their Marriott courtyard are better maintained.
Now for the food, 1st day we have in room lunch( and at night we had a-la-carte at the waterfront; both meals were good. The breakfast for all the three times looked the same. the cakes and juices were the same for the 3 days. On Sunday the breakfast kheema (minced meat ); to our surprise the same kheema(minced meat ) was served as "" Today's special"" in the Dinner! The Buffet dinner was average where you had to ask the staff to warm up the gravies. 
We tried the Simply Grills restaurant for dinner one night the food was great, However they charged us higher that the prices mentioned on the menu. Which we had to point out to get it rectified.
So overall the hotel didn't meet our expectations. We have stayed at the other 5 star hotels like Taj (Augada and Exotica), Grand Hyatt and Holiday inn in Goa, and their level of service in all aspects are far superior than Marriott Goa.",0
455,"This is one place that should be avoided if you don't want to ruin your Goa experience . 

Never ever we had experience such terrible hospitality at any Marriott property across the world 

We had booked 3 rooms for our group of 6 in this so called luxury resort but that was a very big mistake 

We arrived at the hotel around 2 pm and during check in we were informed that rooms are not ready and will take some time . Miss Arantxa checked us in and gave us an upgrade on all three rooms from garden view to bay room for late check in . We signed all the forms and room nos were alloted. We proceeded for lunch on assurance from her that rooms will be ready by the time we have our lunch and luggage will be shifted in them 

When we arrived after lunch , our room nos have changed and we had been downgraded and were asked to wait as rooms were not ready . On asking why rooms have changed when we had been alloted rooms she said I can't help you on that . So much for hospitality 

When we finally got the rooms , one room was stinking badly . On requesting the house keeping they sprayed a room freshener . But the smell did no go and had to call the house keeping again after 2 hrs . 
We told them that we are going out please sort out the smell issue by the time we come back .On returning at 1:00 am they smell was unbearable . On contacting the housekeeping they again sprayed some room freshener and asked us to stay 
But the smell was too much to tolerate and when we blasted the duty manager that they got down to change the filter of Ac . Even after changing the filter when the smell did not go , we were asked to shift to different wing of the hotel with a 3 yr old daughter half sleeps somebody's room . 

It was decided that the hotel can't do anything so we opened the windows and sprayed our perfumes on the blankets and went to sleep .

The next morning on meeting the resident manager Mr Randal that the problem was sorted when he gave us a new room . 

The attitude of the staff can be gauged from the fact that when we ordered coffee at poolside it was refused saying that it is not served there. But we could see that it being served to other guests . Again on talking to duty manager mr Vinay did we got coffee served 

On check out mr Sushil the person at the billing said there was no smell in the room and we had created unnecessary fuss . Then he said that he will wave of 500/- the internet usage charges for our discomfort . 

Luckily Mr rudolf was passing by and he refunded us one night stay . Though the resident manager had the courtesy to refund one night charges still there is lot to be down by this property to come to Marriott standards . 

Thank you Marriott Goa for spiking our holiday",0
456,"Old run down property. Not renovated at all.
Maintenance is clearly an issue as is housekeeping - the windows and glass was dirty and no one has bothered cleaning it.
The service was very good but that was it.
There are far better places to stay in Goa. I would skip this place.",0
457,"I am a Starwood Ambassador Guest for many years (over 100 nights a year). With the merger I was given Platinum Status with Marriott Hotels. I reserved a water view room in Marriott GOA. 4 Days out before my arrival the price of the suite on the internet was cheaper than my water view reservation. I phoned Marriott and they told it was to late (within 7 days of arriving). The morning before I arrived the web site still showed a suite available for the entire stay cheaper than reservation. When I arrived the hotel told me all suites are sold out. This scares me with the merger. Starwood would always match the hotel rates no matter what the situation. 

The hotel is a 3 floor hotel. Unless you smoke you will not be on the top floor. The hotel has not been sound proofed and I was able to hear my neighbours kids cry in morning very clearly. The rooms are not what I would consider close to a 5 star hotel. The resort is small and seems old but the location is good. It is not good value for the money with rooms. 

The restaurants and Lounge were very good. The staff was also very friendly
",0
458,"Just checked into this hotel yesterday for 5 relaxing nights after a hectic 10 days travelling around India and nobody mentioned the building work going on around the pool from early morning to evening. The banging and drilling is very off putting when around the pool area. The work is in front of the "" Oceanside"" buffet restaurant which now has no Oceanside views because of the large tarpaulin put up as barriers. No mention on their website about this work either. The Internet by the pool area is also very intermittent and cuts out regularly. For a 5 star hotel, charging these prices one would expect a lot more.",0
459,"I live in India I don't get a lot of breaks or vacations. So when I do I want a good experience. We this was not a good one. We picked Marriott because I am a member and I always love them. When we arrived the hotel was old and they said it was 17 years old in fact. I still thought ok well it's a Marriott so they will make it better. But I was very very wrong. Yes it was raining and that it didn't help. Because we had to stay inside the hotel most of the time. 

1. The food was just ok nothing like other Marriotts and it was really over priced. 
2. We asked for a room with a balcony so we could at least sit outside. I said cost was no problem. They said next day we could move to a better room. After I called all morning to move they called at 2 and said we could move. I had booked a massage at 2 so I would have to miss it. But we really wanted a better room. They moved us to the same room just on bottom floor. I said to them I wanted a better room this is the same room. They said they didn't have any other rooms I said why move me then? They said the next day they could move me again. I said no I will leave if you can't move my room. I asked them to please call me back. They never did so I changed my holiday to leave early. When I went to check out they then said they are sorry we are leaving and gave me my bill. I said wait you're charging me for today I'm leaving today because you said you don't have the room you said we could have. They said sorry you didn't tell us 7 days before. I said I didn't know 7 days before you wouldn't have the room we asked for. So I said call the manager please. Then they said he was not there they are the managers. I said call him now please. They said he wasn't in the hotel. I said call him then they said oh he's here. He was standing 5 feet away!! So then I told him my story and he then went and asked his staff if this was true. They all told him yes. So they didn't make me pay for the room. 

This was the worst experience I have even had at a Marriott and to be treated like this was crazy. 

Make sure you book the room you want and make sure you get it day one. Don't put up with talking to anyone but the manager the staff will just lie to you. 

The best food we had was the bar free happy hour. 

The massages we finally got booked was very good and we got treated well. Ps you should have a bathing suit for the spa. 

Good luck on your trip",0
460,"Had a feeling am going to the best Resort in Goa as I visited Marriott for the first time in 2014. But over the last 2 years, feel the customer service, especially at the front desk has really come down. Two instances which would make it clear. Being a member of their dining program, I went in an off-season to avail my free night. But much to my dismay, the room i was given was the corner mnost dingiest room anyone could get. And indeed miles away from the main restaurant with absolutely zero-views!! Secondly, next day when I seriously thought of staying till around 3 PM as my flight from the airport was at 6PM, they turned down my request stating that at best i can stay till 1PM. Well, both these instances made me slightly un-welcome and even though their breakfast was a Silver lining and absolutely fantastic, but apart from it I feel this property cares zero for its own members.",0
461,"We stayed for 3 nights with two of our children aged 1 and 6, at Marriot. While it was a mixed feeling of our overall experience, what i would like to bring to Marriot and customers notice, is couple of instances at the hotel, which is not what i expected from a star hotel. 
1. Check in at Marriot is at 4 p.m. and check out is at 12 noon. So based on that you will need to make your flight/travel arrangements. Their lunch timings is 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m., so if you are making a full board booking (including all meals), be assured to miss the lunch
2. On our first day, we went to the beach and were surprised that it was not kept clean. There were hundreds of dead fish, bottles & plastic at the shore and it was unsafe and unhealthy to take the kids for a fun time. Would have expected Marriot to have kept their side of the beach neat, which they did eventually after two days of customers complaining.
3. On the second day of our stay, of course in a holiday mood, we slowly reached the restaurant at 2.45 p.m., but were surprised that none of the staff cared to attend to us. Rather they were closing the buffet services and we and kids were given the last morsels left. The food was being scraped from their vessel to serve it to us. The starters were not refilled and only when we questioned, they were sorry about it and tried to make something from the kitchen. It would have saved us the trouble, if customer service was their utmost priority and they did not want us to let them know of it.
4. The buffet food is not refilled very often and customers are kept waiting. The taste and options are not great and can be improved. Bakery items are good though
5. The rooms are not very spacious for a family with kids, and the property is also not a big one for the price they charge. The lifts are located at quite a distance rooms, since the property is long, so there is a need to walk a bit.
6. On the day we left, they gave us a bag of goodies for kids, and it was nothing but chocos dipped in chocolate sauce and it was really sad. Would have been better they did not give it.

I would appreciate the hotel for things they did, like ones below:
1. Really appreciate Elizabeth from front office and Joseph from restaurant services, who were really sweet and did their best to make us feel comfortable.
2. While the swimming pool has the beach view and is beautiful, it is small in width and quite long. The guards at the pool ensured the kids were safe inside the pool, and they took turns to keep a watch on the kids, without any neglect.
3. Children's play room is good and has a variety of things for kids to play. From books to read, puzzles, toys, Foosball and painting, it is a joy for kids.
4. The property has a beautiful beach view, and room service is good. Not sure if they surprised us with cleaning the room, when we came back from the beach.

Overall, Marriot at Cochin, can surely pass a skill or two on customer service to Goa Marriot. Food-Taste, Quality and options, Hotel Service and Hospitality at its best in Cochin Marriot.",0
462,"Property: Is not very huge for 5 star resort, but of a decent size. Adjacent to beach(River) but didn't seems to be a private beach.

Pool: is very small. but timings are awesome. open till 11pm.

Parking: Every time Valet use to give my car keys to my hand instead of getting my car, and that so sad for Marriott.

Restaurants: Chinese Restaurant(Wan Hao) is sad not worth the money, Main Restaurant's service is awful.

Service: Marriott Goa is super sad in terms of service, 
- Reception staff forgot to serve a water or welcome drink, 
- Service at main Restaurant is even more horrible: There were no napkins or cutlery at table and we got those even after two reminders, we ordered for simple masala dosa and we got that after 40 mins(almost after we finish our breakfast)
- Mr Manu Nair(F & B Manager) sent a sorry cake at our room but again without any spoon, what is Marriott upto???
- Lift stuck almost every time at ground floor, no maintenance at all and the excuse by bellboy was ""Sir its a 16 year old property""...so what? Please repair guys, its not a small town single star hotel.
- When we came back from pool, one of our room was open and no one was around. when we tried to search, suddenly a guy came from far lobby and told us that they are cleaning the room, you guys can clean the rooms but someone has to be thr always, normally we just kept out valuables on table or desk.


Overall: Not at all recommended by me and my family, super bad experience with such a high cost. Not expected from Marriott :(

PS: I know the General Manager will share his same old apology jargon(Copy paste sorry words... Thank you for taking the time to pen...)",0
463,"The property looks awesome in pics on the Internet. It is very highly rated on a few websites

These things got us fooled.

We chose Goa Marriott over Taj Village and Grand Hyatt (Where we regularly go).

Reception Staff was very very courteous and nice. That was the only bright spot.

But overall I thought that the hotel was hugely overpriced.

Breakfast was very crowded and nearly fixed menu on all 3 days.

Rooms were smaller and conjusted as compared to other hotels worth the same price.

Room Service and food was good at times and very bad at timorth

Pool is very small and just of 4ft depth.

Overall - my worst stay at Goa.",0
464,"Costa del sol, in India. No charm, tacky, expensive, terrible food and cheesy happy hours. We arrived and they didn't have the room we booked so we had to pay a lot for an upgrade, which should have been given free of charge as the fault was theirs. The hotel is totally dated, no beach. Breakfast was not good. Not worth the money. Stay somewhere with spirit!!",0
465,"The cold cut selection had anaemic chicken salamis and nothing else. Possibly the worst I have seen in any hotel of this category.The egg benedict arrived cold. The ham on it was pale and limp , the bread dead. The potato wedges were soggy and cold . Egg benedict is meant to be a sinful indulgence .This one looked like I was in a remote Russian motel in the late 90s . In winter .The executive chef would do well to try the dish in Zoe's in Mumbai or even Saltwater in Bandra. And i will never understand why Marriott cant have some decent Goan bread - Unde , pao and poyee .
Now you would say most of the guests in this hotel are Indians and dont really want an eggs ben or a fresh sausage.
So lets talk about their South Indian breakfast -
Dumpy , hard ,cold solid idlis sat in the warmer heavy with yeast.The chutneys - if a Cafe Madras or MTR cook served them he would be executed not sacked. The sambar was watery and lukewarm . The ""ghee"" for the gunpowder was in the process of solidifying . The upma in the buffet was cold and dry totally devoid of the moist flavour that it meant to have .In his effort to make me a crisp Dosa the chef burnt it bitter ! Knowing food in big branded hard marketed chain hotels I had gone in with modest expectations primarily because the hotel has a good waterside location.But Marriott Panjim was worse than those modest expectations .The coffee came repeatedly not so hot . The staff are extremely charming , courteous, helpful and friendly.They were nice shirts with stylish red buttons and cool M ! They do structured well coached PR with guests. But they cant compensate for the terrible food that would put a roadside place in Queensway or an Udipi out of business in 7 days if not 3 !",0
466,"Location of the Marriott Panjim property is wonderful - views stretching from Cabo Raj to Aguada - nice boat marinas , right in Panjim city, just on the rivermouth, the riverfront promenade well laid - out, the lounge at the lobby is excellent .. guys at the security pretty decent and helpful .. that's the good part.

The F & B team at the restaurants ... attitude resembling ex - bureacrats after early retirement .. Was there 28th - 30th March ' 15 ; Simply Grills the riverfront seafood area was proud to declare that no seafood available after 7 PM ... great tearing hurry to shoo guests away. The display counter was kept deliberately empty.
Went on to the Coffee Shop; Marriott stewards/stewardress would not allow us to sit outside in the open area late in the evening as it was ""too humid for them to serve there"".. never mind that the guest is ok to sit in humid conditions. We dutifully agreed not to sit outside as we thought that the stewards / stewardress might be worried about their own make-up & hair being spoilt in the heat !! So we no options left within Marriott Panjim Goa ; we walked down to the excellent Mum's Kitchen ( 5 minutes away) for a delicious meal of .. think what ""seafood""
Not much imagination in the Coffee Shop buffets .. just the same oily stuff rotating. There is a Chinese section tucked away on the right which is somewhat better.

So location great , service "" a huge no comments"".

Lest anyone reading this feel that this review is from a one-time visitor ; I have lived in Panjim for 6+ years and been seeing how this property has been trending in terms of service.So this review comes after probably 60 + visits incuding weekend room stays , restaurant visits etc. You can really feel the difference when you experience the warmth at the other 5 star property located in Panjim.",0
467,We are goans and have been coming to this hotel for years.... But never experienced such embarrassment. We came to eat at the waterfront and requested the staff to serves us by the pool at the grill restaurant. My ceaser salad and wine was served but when my guests joined us they said they couldn't. We requested them to make an exception but Akash at the grill restaurant was soo rude and strict with policies. If we wanted we could have made few calls and being hotelier ourselves making an exception to delight the guest is taught and followed. Shame to see such an amazing hotel with amazing food is getting worst because if such staff. But an exception was the waterfront staff who were amazing and wanted to help us but got manipulated by Akash and other grill staff ( as they were ganging up behind the bar and discussing what to say) exception for Chagan for his extra services and good communication skill.,0
468,"The property is located centrally and quite convenient. It is clean and well kept. But this is all there is to recommend it. Their hospitality is wanting. 

I am currently attending a conference at this hotel, and was shocked to find the mini-bar locked (it was previously open) when I returned to my room. On enquiring, I was informed that the hotel co-ordinator asked the doors to be locked for all guests attending the conference. I cannot help but wonder at how arbitrarily it has been done. I know that the mini-bar services need to be paid for, and it is obvious that the bill can be settled while checking out. Somehow, this is something that is obviously beyond the hotel management to understand.

It is surprising that a purportedly 5 star property not only contradicts all tenets of hospitality, but it also violates guest privacy, with hotel staff entering at will, at odd times and making any changes they want in the guest's absence, on orders of some vague people. It was obvious that the staff did not come to make the beds or for any other purpose, as the room is otherwise in exactly the same state as it was before I left for dinner. I find this absurd and absolutely disgusting. If it were not for the conference that I am attending here, and the people who I know staying here as well, I would have checked out immediately.",0

Loud and obnoxious family groups in which the staff members did nothing to quieten them down, especially by the pool. For the cost of this hotel and the facilities I would not recommend it. Much more value at the Park Hyatt. Disappointing and well over priced.",0
472,"This hotel does not qualify the 5 stars ratings, after reviewing comments reported in here I truly wonder whether I stayed in the same Mariott hotel in Goa! First of all this hotel is need a major housekeeping ""clean up"" and upgrade/refurbishment; 
Walking the guests corridors you will get a preview of what guests rooms might look like..dirty/stained carpets, torn wall papers.in my room(211) I requested the broken lamp shade to be replaced, one of the mounted wall reading lamps remained loose the entire stay, dark stained bathroom edges, shower out of order even It was mentioned to guests services for repair,no follow up on the matter, I finally gave up all bed pillows could do with replacement etcSo much for housekeeping services!
Occasionally I returned to my room when Attendant were servicing and cleaning, at no time I was asked for my identity, I was allowed to walk in freely. Else where normally he/she would let you in only once the key card would have been validated and verified.So much for preventive security!
The breakfast service was simply pathetic as after a week long stay you don't get to see any food variation, it takes ages to get the first coffee serving, well very much ""canteen style"" set up!
Last don't come up with too complicated services requests that are out of the limited routine, staff is not well trained to respond rapidly and creatively, everything out of line seem to be much efforts askingoften frustrating!
Staff is generally working hard, attitude is somewhat robotic often avoiding guests contact and greetings, a pity as from experience in other Hotels in India, people can truly be friendly and attentive.
This is not a cheap hotel to stay and except for its location I certainly would not choose to return!",0
473,"We had an enjoyable stay at the Goa Marriott end of January.
The staff were nice and friendly. Special thanks go to Delila Almeida at the front desk for making our stay a memorable one.

Overall, a pleasant place to stay in Goa !",1

475,"It is an excellent place to stay at this resort. Rooms are very very tidy and very much spacious. The staff here are very much cordial. The bay view rooms are simply superb as u can just have a view of the sea from your bed itself.We can spend our complete day here enjoying at the beach as they have a private beach access. They even provide with cycles if you want to go for a cycle ride near the beach.They even have the sitting chairs just to sit and have the view of beach.They have spa services which are free for the guests. They have kids room where from a toddler to teens can enjoy and the staff over there are so helpful that u need not worry the child's security even if you are not available for 10 mins around. They have a private swimming pool area which is very well maintained and very decent. They even have casino over there. Related to food, the breakfast is the one you can vouch for. Very delicious, u have so many varieties ranging from south Indian, continental, north Indian,veg, non veg everything. We being vegetarian had so many options to taste l really felt cherished to see so many options like idli,dosa,vada and the list continues. The fruits and sprouts were also there along with juices. A special mention has to be done for parathas as they prepare simply superb ones giving us a feel of a true north Indian one. A special mention for Mr. Sahil who was there at the front desk who provided us with the bay and double bed accommodation.He was so helpful and so genuine and told us also the options which are available for the guests during our stay.There is nothing to complain or find discomfort in the services provided. The only suggestion I felt was if they have some rooms in cottages style or say villa style which will be like feather on a cap.",1

The welcome at the hotel was fantastic - fresh juice and a complimentary upgrade to a sea view room. We decided to pay 2000 rupees per day to have access to the exec lounge (free soft drinks all day, 5-7pm free alcoholic drinks and buffet and breakfast) which was well worth it. The pool area is nice, the hotel in good condition and staff fantastic. We tended to walk into the main town and went out to a few fun karaoke bars on Thurs night. All food was lovely, the breakfast is superb and I'd recommend staying here.",1
478,We recently enjoyed a short break at the Goa Marriott after a hectic week touring Rajasthan. The hotel is in a great location overlooking a bay and other parts of Goa though far enough from the inlet where the casino ships are located. We found the staff so friendly and helpful and our room (we treated ourselves to a suite) was recently refurbished and very nicely fitted out with a spa like bathroom and balconies overlooking the water. We did very little during our stay though we found all the facilities we used very good and well maintained. The only gripe if any was the local call charges which are expensive. The hotel is located near Panajim which we walked round and were underwhelmed so you are better off exploring the Candolim area which is very geared to looking after tourists. We would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.,1
479,"We arrived for 1 week break from Dubai journey took 3 hrs approx, we managed to get taxi to hotel ( beware as they drive very fast ). Our hotel was awaiting our arrival so our check in was easy and out efficient. The room was very lovely dressed up with lots of red petals and towels made into animals, The view from our balcony was a sea view it was nice to watch the sunset in the evening !! Always lots of bottled water available !!
Our food was very good from pizza to goan curry all lovely, but cold sadly I asked a few times for it to be reheated...we liked to taste some of the curriy dishes and naan bread was delicious...some of the staff were rude when they marched in front of you and got there food first,it's just not nice, and when I asked one chef Khim for pizza he replied you don't get it it's not included in the full board, but we were quite happy to pay , its my choice !! the chef Gopi made us feel welcome let us try some amazing dishes we even had fish and chips one evening , salmon another !! Jason stood out for us in the dining lounge to he was very helpful and did things quickly when we asked ( some took ages for a pot of hot water ) he spoke great English too !! 
Happy hour was free from 5-7 pm all drinks were good and wine Jacobs Creek , we even took our wine with us for dinner !! Excellent staff very attentive !!
We went to the spa had a massage it was lovely not to expensive either , used the sauna and jacuzzi we felt very relaxed !! 
Its a busy hotel most days fully booked, we always seemed to get a sun lounger most days and nice fresh towels.. pool very cold but nicely situated and it gets hot hot hot !!
Room attention was wonderful nothing to much trouble for them, very clean sheets towels everyday and lovely products shower gel etc available !! I even received a flower arrangement too of lilies !! Hairdryer in room was a little small so glad I took my own one !! Aircon had no noise at all, but got woke up by noisy plumbing on a few occasions. ( banging noise) annoying !!
The only negative things we felt was lots and lots of rubbish lying out with the hotel made Goa not nice for tourists,felt a little invaded when dining as staff was sometimes to attentive we just wanted some quiet time !! Mosquitoes were everywhere my husband got a few bites when in Azure Lounge Bar , Waterfront Restaurant, bedroom,lobbies,we had 3 plug ins in our bedroom and wrist bands but still got bites !! 
All in all we had a good time and everything went as planned the hotel is a lovely place and staff attentive, wish we could remember all staff names but we can't but thank you to them and for there help !!",1
480,"Stayed here for three nights over the Holidays and found it to be in a great location to explore North and South Goa and the beaches as day trips. It is well located for restaurants and nightlife as well. We even took the bus into Panjim a few times and that was not a problem at all. The hotel was very accommodating in arranging transportation for us for our excursions in the area, and when one of the days we had a car that was not to the quality expected and driver had an attitude, the hotel staff were quick to address the issue. Had breakfast at the hotel and enjoyed the variety of local cuisine. Chef even made me a banana lassi, even though it was not on the standard buffet! The beach and pool area are pleasant and nice to relax at. It was a bit sad to see the garbage on the beach (not necessarily by the hotel, but on the stretch of beach we walked) and generally felt like no one cared to clean up after themselves. Would be great if the hotel organized beach cleanups or such events where the hotel guests can feel like they are helping with the local environment and perhaps even get the opportunity to interact with the locals some. Overall, good experience.",1
481,"Very peaceful place despite being middle of residential area. Access to the night life in Panjim is very easy from here. 

Breakfast is always excellent here. Many options to choose from. Staff is very helpful.",1
482,"The spot is idyllic with beautiful views all around over the river and out into the Arabian Sea, the entry hall  which is open to the air  is spectacular, and the grounds lush and well looked after. The staff were helpfulness itself, friendly without being too in your face, and some of the food was outstanding. We spent a couple of evenings eating by the pool and the selection of sea food, think fresh lobsters, crabs, sea bass, was excellent and the cooking first rate. The skill and thoughtfulness of one of the more senior of staff, Mandeep I think was his name, would not have disgraced a maitre d' in a major city. Some of the facilities such as the gym room were better than the health club I belong to back home.

OK, a lovely place. So why not an excellent rating? First were the prices. A bottle of average French wine, say $10 in a supermarket was about $80 at the bar. Likewise the prices for the meals were comparable with international prices which isn't quite fair given we were in India. The hotel taxi service though efficient was about 50% over local limousine prices. Second, although the hotel tried to clean the beach in front of the hotel  even having a permanent person making sure that people walking along it didn't peep in  the river itself wasn't swimmable in and wild dogs wandered on it too. The dogs couldn't have got in but that wasn't pleasant.",1
483,"This property has tremendous staff and service - the Bay view rooms afford great views - especially the sunset. 
Shubert, Vinod, Harris and Saraansh and Gopal deserve a special mention.
It is a property with nice views but the place needs urgent upgrade and modernisation.",1
484,"Dear Manager & Staff

I am writing to express my appreciation for the quality of service you offered my family & I during our stay at the hotel.

We could see from day one that the hotel has a great quality, both because of its comfortable and appropriate facilities, as well as service and constant concern for our comfort. Thank you especially for being aware of our requirements.

I will definitely recommend your hotel to friends and family, and Im sure Ill be back again and hope to receive the same quality of service when I return. 

Names of staff particularly I remembered who went the extra mile for us are : Akash, Rutesh, Sarvesh, Rohidas, Damson, Jason, Leny, Philip, Raymond, Antony, Durgesh, & Rohit.
everyone at the Water Front Team really was outstandingly helpful and I can't praise everyone enough.

Raj & Simran from the Water Front Team - both of you bring a very special atmosphere and my words arent enough to say thank you to both of you. My kids can't stop talking about you and Raj - Ashley is missing you

Also all the staff at Az.U.r Lobby Lounge were fantastic. Thanks for making my stay excellent.

To finish off, the view, the cleanliness, the complimentary items and the comfort was exceptional. There is no way on earth that we could ever fault the service or standards, amazing experience and one we won't forget in a hurry.

Thanks to everyone at the Marriott Goa

485,"Very good location and good service. Special thanks to front desk guy Ashley. He is Very helpful, polite and guest friendly. Food is also good. We enjoyed our stay at this Goa Marriot property. This property also provides airport pick up and drop, complimentary. Ashley arrange all our sight seen tour at very good price. This hotel also drop guests at local market as complementary.",1
486,"Me and my wife stayed at this hotel as part of our honeymoon and we had the most incredible stay! The staff were most attentive and nothing was ever too much to ask! The hotel is great and we shall most definitely be staying here in the future.

The hotel is in a quiet part of North Goa, with all lovely areas easily accessible. There is plenty to do if you wish or it is very easy to relax and unwind at the poolside.

A special thank you must go out to our driver who picked us up from the airport and took us on two day trips, Leeladhar Gawas. A huge thank you to Shilpa who worked part of the kitchen and welcomed us to the hotel. A special thank you to both Chefs Gopi and Murgesh who made a special meal for when we were poorly, and even offered to make us snacks for our onward journey and flight. Shanu, a waiter at the simply grill was great, and made our valentines meal most memorable. Kashinath, our room attendant had the most creative towel art, and the pool attendant, who's name I have misplaced, but my gratitude is still great towards.

Thank you for a great stay Marriott!

487,"I arranged to take my wife to the Sunday brunch on her 50th birthday we also used the pool facilities.All I can say is what a fantastic day it was nothing was to much trouble all the staff very attentive, my wife had a fantastic time Joseph and his staff really looked after her on her special day . They even supplied a cake without me asking , memories that will always be with us.",1
488,"We had booked Marriott for 4 days in the last week of January for a much needed break with our 20 month old daughter and boy did the staff ensure we had a nice time! Although the property was full for the long weekend, we were given personal attention starting from the airport pick-up to checking-in to booking a table for dinner and even during the happy hours in the gorgeous lobby of theirs. 
The rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was yum. I have to thank Sanket (Asst. front office manager) for his attention & ensuring my daughter gets her 'special meals' and milkshakes throughout the day. The kids play area and the casino are a huge advantage over other properties in Goa.
Being in the city center, almost everything is approachable which is an advantage when you travel with family. The only drawback I can think of is the beach - where a lot of boats come to pick-up and drop tourists, taking away the 'secluded feel'. The pool and the bar at the pool is nice, and over all - we were very happy with our stay and the friendly staff ensured we were at ease always.
Definitely worth another visit",1
489,"Excellent facility. Spacious rooms. Wifi is free but just for mails. Higher speed at a reasonable rate of 250 plus taxes.
Sea facing rooms are expensive to Garden facing rooms.
Nice swimming pool facing Sea/ Madovi river is very good.
Garden is very green and they have an excellent SPA.
Breakfast spread is very good and quality of food they serve is excellent.
Nice cosy bar and the two restaurants are very good.
Hospitality is top of the world 
Would like to come again here",1
490,"From using the pick up service from the airport the stay was excellent. The staff are so attentive and polite and the facilities are immaculate. The last night we dined at simply grille and the food was great I opted for the tenderloin steak. The pool bar was really nice with great service and just what was needed after a day in the conference suite. Next time I hope to come for a holiday and spend a bit longer exploring what Goa has to offer.

Great trip",1
491,"I am a Marriott Platinum Premium Elite Member for over 10 years and try to stay at Marriott properties most of the time. We had 5 ocean front rooms. The setting was beautiful but the personal attention of the staff was exceptional, especially Sanket Athavale, Asst. Front Office Manager, and Delilah Almeida, Guest Relations Manager. They took care of all our needs and made extra effort to make our experience very memorable.
We were treated like royalty.",1

I stayed here from 9feb to 15 feb and on leaving day i was in tears to leave them so much love they all gave and very nice resort with the staff in Restaurant very helpful they packed me lunch also on the day of leaving.... Loved the stay very well done...",1
493,"We went to Goa and stayed for 3 days before moving on .The service ,food and rooms were all excellent.Most of the staff couldn't do enough to help and the location was very good. There was also breakfast and a happy hour[2 hours] where the food was and drink was included with the breakfast which was extremely good value.",1
494,"Superb hotel , great team,i really enjoyed my stay, food was great. Breakfast experience and spread was amazing. Housekeeping was quick to all the request. I will surely recommend goa marriott to my friend.",1
495,We visited the hotel for Sunday buffet lunch The choice of food was amazing From hot Indian food to salads bread and fruit Drinks are included in the price The range of puddings and pastries was also incredible From Indian puddings to delicious bite size cakes,1
496,"The marriott in panjim is very well located. In the heart of the city but still tucked in. The hotel was packed and lobby was buzzing with activity. The rooms attached to the lawns are very nice. The service is excellent. Wide variety of cuisines. Sea food, Chinese and the coffee shop. Touching the mandovi river gives the property lovely views.",1
497,"Myself and my husband were recommended to eat here on Christmas Day, during our recent trip to Goa. We were highly impressed with the enormous variety of food on offer, but were particularly struck by how tasty and homemade everything was. I loved the soup and salads so much that I emailed the hotel in the hope of getting some recipes. Imagine my delight when I got a quick response from the head chef, who was delighted to share with me. I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a tasty meal.",1
498,"A fab place to stay in... try the patio bay view or bay view rooms...Service is pretty much above average. Check in and check outs are very quick. Overly Courteous staff all around. they catches your eye and runs into you if you want anything. Breakfast excellent...there are beautiful restaurant & bars inside the Hotels. Best was the swim up Pool Bar.... just a bit improvement at the pool bar is a good quality music is missing out. Place for Kids toddlers, relaxing experience i had with SPA. And has a amazing private beach. Special arrangements are upto the marks if you need. In total it was an amazing experience staying in .... DDDD",1
499,"1. The team at the coffee shop went all out to look at bfast options for my lil daughter. One of the Chef even made a small micky mouse shaped pancake topped with chocolate sauce especially for her. Am sorry dont remember the name (Was it Chef Gomez?). Thanks Chef.
2. The housekeeping person who would clean the room daily, made a towel animal everyday for my daughter to play with. She loved it. Thanks Surag.

Overall a lovely experience.
Thanks",1

From check in where Absil helped me with the new app to register online, to Kuber at the pool who always has a smile and cannot do enough for you, to the bar and restaurant staff who were also first class. I would not hesitate to recommend a stay here",1
501,"We saw the online Facebook page of Alila Diwa giving details of Sunday brunch and the phone no.It read as

Alila Diwa Goa
July 8, 2012  
Sunday brunch Diwa Style
Make your lazy Sunday a little more exotic with our indulgent brunch. Wide variety of food and beverages at INR 950++ | Live music by Emmanuel. Call 9049997537 for more information.
1 We called the said no -NO RESPONSE
2 We got the phone no of FnB manager 9049997530 from a friend-NO RESPONSE
3 We got a no from the online Alila site-NO RESPONSE
4 We called their duty manger who finally booked our table
5 The AC was not effective in indoor seating so we had to move out
6 Food -below average,Service-rude specially a waiter called Abhay,Jayesh incharge of buffet charged us 1500/- per head for non -alcoholic package for 4 people whereas the advertised rate is 950/- plus taxes-will the taxes be more than 50%!!!
I had great memories of the Sunday brunch as well as other occasions I dined their for parties.But very disappointed with their standard and service .Not to mention a total rip off with absolutely no value for money.",0
502,"We are here for 4 nights. The buffet menu seldom changes. They keep repeating the salads, desserts and ice creams. The staff does not seem bothered. The food is over but until you ask them to refill they dont seem to realise. The staff passing by doesnt greet you or even smile. Rooms are very dimly lit. Its actually very depressing to sit in the rooms. There is no recreational activities for adults.",0
503,Poor hotel management. We booked this hotel through an agent for 4 days. We called hotel 2 days prior our arrival and confirmed if hotel received full payment and they confirmed the same with us. Even during check in at reception I asked if they received payment they again confirmed and on last day they told us that they have not received payment and we were asked to pay in full immediately. We wasted the entire day to sought out the mess and hotel didn't care and finally they accepted that they have received the payment.,0
504,We are currently residing at Alila Diwa;but we are thoroughly disappointed with the food.we have always stayed in 5star and above properties in Goa but have never had such a bad experience when it comes to food....when u pay such an heavy amount for your holiday there are basic expectations for food...it is bland as if made for the non Indians palate..we had unfortunately taken a three meal plan..will never recommend this hotel. As much I loved the property we hated the food,0
505,"wful experience! If you want a quite relaxing tranquil holiday as described please make sure you check there are no indian weddings taking place or conferences.During our ten night stay we had two weddings each lasting 2/3 days.The infinity pool was taken over for a private pool party twice lasting all day,extremely loud music all day with heavy drinking in the pool,drones flying everywhere (no privacy) ,On the wedding day we were woken at 5am with heavy base music ,this continued till the ceremony which started at 5pm the disco not finishing until 5.30 am.It was more like the clubbing holidays my children go on ,not the relaxing break we expected.I understand the weddings generate a lot of money, however i do expect to get what was advertised,i do not feel we should be pushed out and unable to use the facilities we paid for.This is the third time we have been to this hotel ,we returned because it is a beautiful hotel in a fabulous setting with amazing staff,last time we went there was a conference where the pool was also out of bounds but we thought that this was a one off.I think if the functions were kept to one area and the other guests were not compromised most people would not have an issue however there were 3 couples to our knowledge who had also been several times before but will also not be returning.VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR SUCH A LOVELY HOTEL!",0
506,"While the first impression the property and staff gives you is exceptional and it kind of takes away the struggle of reaching to the property, the hard reality bites soon enough. 

As there were 2 rooms booked by us, I called early morning from the airport to ensure rooms are together. upon arrival we were told that only 1 rooms available. took them over 2 hours to get the other room allotted (mind you we reached post their check-in time). 

rooms had several issues and most of the 1st day of check-in went getting the room facilities fixed. bathroom flush, ACON fan, bathroom door, basin flooding, bathtub jammed take the top position that I cant forget even if I want to.

staff showed their concern by apologizing but hardly took any action to confirm their concern for guests. in room dining staff should maybe shifted to other department as they cant differentiate a pasta sauce to khichadi (steamed rice mixed with Indian dal).

it was only on the end of the stay when I had had enough I tried escalating the issue and the duty manager, but by then it was way to late to patch things up. 

she did her best by booking us a shuttle and taking care of the incidentals on our check-out. but really if I was too much concerned on saving a 1000 - 2000 INR, I would not have booked an expensive property such as Alila in a town like Goa which is filled with options. 

Throughout the stay our floor was getting painted and walls were being patched that gave an impression of staying in a make shift arrangement kinda place. November and December are the peek months and any hotel with a 5 star tag should appreciate this much in advance. 

a completely dissatisfied experience and a total NO for future!

508,Hotel employs thief's !! Personal belonging stolen from car during my stay this watch out !! Never give your car to the chauffeur at this hotel .Food sucks especially breakfast ...repeat the same menu daily !! Will never visit this hotel again !!,0
509,"In September15 I decided to undergo a 21-day detox program at Spa Alila after talking to its young and passionate head of department - Dr Arjita Kumari. Her confidence was infectious and even though the cost of the program is pretty hefty I signed up within hours of meeting her : as you can imagine she is a sales-person par excellence.

Unfortunately, sales person is all that she is! I have been doing detox programs every year for the last two decades but never before have I ever been in a situation where my health was compromised. Within days of starting the program, my blood pressure fell to unprecedented levels. By day 13 my metabolism was shot to a point where I had a gastro attack of such severity that I could neither breathe or speak. Each time I brought my condition up to the Dr, I was categorically told that it was normal.

It is not normal but I do understand that sometimes when we do a program like this, things can go wrong. But what I don't understand is the casual outlook and complete lack of corrective measures on the part of Dr. Instead of using her skills as a medical doctor the only thing she could offer was some sort of alternate healing mumbo-jumbo. So visualise this - you are so sick that you cannot breathe, the left side of your body is in tremendous pain, you are wondering if you are getting a cardiac arrest and the medical Dr whose supervision you are under does not take your blood pressure, or pulse, doesnt give you any medication instead picks up a crystal and starts to chant hoping that your condition will pass! Un-freakin believable, but true.

When I decided to bring it up to the General Manager, he point-blank told me that their spa programs are casual / recreational even though the printed brochure for the said program suggests otherwise. What I found even more horrifying is that despite putting this in the knowledge of the General Manager not one person (yes, thats right, not even one person) from the management called to ask after my health or well-being even though I was in the hotel for another four days recuperating. (I quit the program as soon as I was well enough to do so i.e. on 17th day)

Alila is an international brand with 5-star properties across Asia and I am simply appalled that not only are they running such a third-class program under their banner but also their management doesn't give a fig for someone who may fall seriously sick during their stint at the property.

Other observations included ants in my bed and on the WC, clogged shower drains, expired products placed for usage in the shower area etc etc.. the list is endless! But not everything is bad with the property. The design aesthetic of the hotel is fantastic. The yoga teacher and male therapist Ajay is beyond fabulous. I appreciated GMs offer to return the balance from the advance money I had paid for the program in vouchers once he acknowledged my lack of faith in the program.

To sum it up, Alila Diwa Goa is like The Lady in Red  she will totally seduce you with her beauty and her charms but scratch the surface and you are in for a ride to hell and back i.e. if you are lucky!",0
510,"We rented three rooms in Alila from 30may - 2nd june.. the experience was terrible and i am not ever going back to this crap place ..
pros - our rooms were upgraded to diwa wedding because the hotel was booked for a wedding and they did not want to disturb our peace.. the only highlight of the trip .. the worse then stared..

cons - they took around 2 hrs for us to checkin.. one room was provided in 30mins and rest were to take another 30mins more .. got them after almost 1hr 25mins!! no apologies from the team ... 
2) the room service is sub-standard.. we had baby bottles to sterilize .. they take around 30mins to send some one with numerous reminders .. this happened consistently across all three days and for all the rooms we booked.. on one occasion they did not return the bottle and i called up the reception on numerous times.. it was 11:30pm and i told them also to not ring the bell since our baby was sleeping.. and guess what they ring the bell and then also call on the phone!!
3) breakfast was useless.. the juices were plain water and sour.. and even the wedding party folks were complaining
4) this is the worst that happened.. there is restn called Martins corner which is about 600mts (5mins walk and 2mins by car) .. we were returning from the restn around 8:30pm.. we had five kids who were tired.. we tried to ask local cabs and they responded they had tied up with hotel and will only come if they ask them to.. we called the hotel and they said 800rs for the 2mins ride from martins to hotel .. it was a loot.. we were not even given the bill... next day i complained and somebody in reception confirmed we were overcharged but nothing happened.. these guys are working hand in glove with local cabs to find ways to loot hotel guests.. 
5) lots of other incidents wrt to service.. room cleaning doesnt come when asked to for instance..ordered pizza, the guy says sir the pizza will come from a vivo restn located in another wing and pizza will get soggy and will take 45mins!!! really who are u kidding here..

never coming back here.. totally ruined it for us..",0
511,"Good hotel overall but grossly mismanaged. You have a feeling that at every stage of your stay they try to extract as much money from you as possible and you are only there for that purpose. A couple of examples:
- We had a private yoga class and it is 1500 Rps per hour. When we got a bill we were billed for 2 persons, i.e. 3000 Rps and the manager told us that if it would be 4 people it would be 6000 Rps for the same hour of yoga. Keep in mind that they pay 10000 Rps to the yoga instructor per month! The rest goes to the hotel. The same is with the massage as it costs from 3500 Rps (this is before taxes which add another 30%) and they pay just 10000 Rps per month to people doing massage. 
- We asked for the bicycle and were told that it is 350 Rps per 2 hours. Keep in mind that in Goa one day of renting a scooter is 300 Rps and 1 day of renting a car is 1200 Rps and compare it with the hotel price for the bicycles. In most hotels bicycles are complimentary but not in this one. They are there to extract the money from you.
- The taxi to the airport costs 1300 Rps and what they do is just ask the taxi standing in front of the hotel, which is priced at 900-1000 Rps. The rest goes to the hotel for nothing. 
- The food is also grossly overpriced. The bottle of Old Monk Rum is 160 Rps just outside the hotel and they sell it at 125 Rps per shot. The same is with everything in the menu. Although the food is of good quality you cannot ask 250 Rps for steamed rice in India. 

So in total we spent as much in the hotel as for the rooms, i.e. $5000 USD for one week. If you think that this money goes to the nearby community you are completely wrong. The road to the beach is approximately 500 meters and is full of litter. Only $100 USD would be enough to pay for the local people to clean it but obviously the hotel does not care about it. They are there to extract the money. This is the shame and very disappointing that a good hotel is managed in this barbaric way which is obvious to travelers and to local people. 

For that price they even cannot provide the clean towels to the beach as all towels we were given had stains and were covered with sand (unlike clean towels to the swimming pool). The WiFi speed in the hotel is also almost absent. You would expect decent WiFi in a 5-star hotel and for that price.",0
512,"This review has taken a long while to write, but nonetheless, here it is! We stayed May 2014 and had booked for a 5 night stay based on the good reviews we saw on tripadvisor and also through personal recommendation. HOWEVER, the minute we arrived in Goa was when the poor experience of Alila Diwa started. We were greeted (If you could call a grunt a greet) with our name card outside the airport. The man that grunted at us was on his phone and basically hand signalled to us and pointed to the direction in which we should be going to collect our airport transfer. We were told this would be a car transfer upon booking. We were surprised that a 50 seater coach, instead, came to pick us up. We were the only ones sat on a 50 seater coach travelling on our very bumpy journey to the hotel. We arrived to no greeting at all this time and loitered around in the hotel until somebody came to us. We finally checked in and were taken to our room. The surrounding hotel looked lovely and we decided to dismiss our bumpy journey and proceed to enjoying our holiday. Our room disappointingly was a twin room when we paid for King. We then transferred rooms after 4 hours!! The manager kindly allowed us a meal on the house, however, in what is supposed to be their 'top class restaurant' in Goa, there were bugs embedded within their glass tables. Our meals were, hence, not very appetising. Once we got into a newly transferred room, we discovered the bed sheets were stained, the light switches were not working and the elevator was making a very loud sound. If after reading this review, you still choose to stay at Alila Diwa, DO NOT stay in a room next to the elevator!!! 
Once again (and by this time it was midnight) we transferred rooms again. 3rd time lucky.....NO! The AC unit was not working!!! They did not transfer us again and instead, decided to call upon an electrician at 2am in the morning to fix our AC! The hotel, at first glance, looks lovely but please please think before booking this hotel. The next day we immediately found other hotels (the Taj Goa and The Leela, which were FANTASTIC and what is expected of 5* resorts!!) The manager at Alila Diwa was kind enough to not charge us for our 1 night's hellish stay, but this was after MUCH commotion!! Service poor, cleanliness poor, Alila Diwa ..... POOR!!!!",0
513,"Hi, 
I visited the resort with my friends and I was robbed of my Samsung phone worth 10k and cash of 1000rs My friend with whom I shared the same room also lost 2000rs.
Also there were 4 other friends robbed of cash while we all were away to the beach which is close by (only 10 mins away). I waited for 1month but there was not even 1 mail/call from the resort informing me about the investigation. This sort of behaviour is not at all expected of a 5 star resort they should take some serious measures and rectify things. Totally spoilt my holiday :(",0
514,"I am very surprised by how bad Alila Goa was, considering that they are a 5 star hotel and supposedly reputable. Firstly the good part...the room is spacious and bathroom is big with a wardrobe. However the bathroom opens up totally into the room, which is fine for honeymooning couples. However, if you are planning a corporate trip or friends trip.....hmmmmm. luckily there are 4 sliding doors to close.
Now the downside.........the front office staff is not trained to handle big groups...even on the day i departed there was another big group coming in and there was chaos. I had asked for specific rooms to be given but the front office just messed up
Secondly, the management is not flexible in assisting guest. I made several request but was told it cannot be accommodated
Thirdly, the food was bad......even my local Indian colleagues complained that the food was not up to mark
Fourthly the restaurant staff were not efficient. my colleagues requested for water, coffee etc and the staff either forgot or was not interested to serve. Each meal we had at the restaurants, they were dropping utensils, plates regularly.
this hotel may be good for couples but definitely not able to handle big groups...and i would return again. There are better choices in Goa for less than the price my company paid for it.",0
515,"I visited Alila Diwa first in November, 2013. I had gone to see the hotel as a suitable venue for hosting a wedding, and while we came back very impressed with the rooms, we could not nail down a deal for hosting the wedding. Never the less, I was told that I should come back to the hotel, to stay right after the wedding, so as to unwind and relax, and was promised excellent hospitality. My wife and I went to Alila Diwa right after the wedding, and I have to admit, I was extremely disappointed with the hotel and the hotel staff. Ive highlighted pros and cons from my stay at the hotel: 

Pros:
1. The rooms were absolutely excellent. The size of the rooms was very good, as were the services within the room. Thumbs up to the house-keeping for organizing it so well. 
2. The property itself is quite nice to walk around, and to just sit back and relax. Definitely a very home like experience with 5* feel to it. 
3. We forgot a few items at the hotel. And the house keeping staff were friendly enough to find it and have it sent back to our address. 


Cons: 
1. Checking in to the hotel was a very painful experience. The reception desk staff took well over 20 minutes to check us in on a not so busy Saturday. Never the less, I requested her for the best room in the hotel as it was a special occasion, yet she kept saying that the hotel is full and all she can give us is a regular room on the first floor. I cant complain about the room (as I liked it), but I did not like the attitude of the staff as they made no efforts to make our experience a pleasant one. 
2. The food definitely did not live up to 5* standards and was definitely over priced. We ordered food to our room  and were not impressed with the quantity of food delivered  as it was barely enough for one person to eat, and wasnt cooked well enough. The spread at breakfast was excellent, but the quality of food disappointed me. 
3. We requested for a late check-out but the reception staff wasnt receptive to that. She kept insisting the hotel is fully booked (which it wasnt by any stretch of imagination) and thus they needed us to vacate our room, they kept insisting that we leave the property early. 
4. What is with the hotel and taxi nexus! They over charge us for every possible trip (Although I am sure this is a problem not specific to Alila Diwa).

Alila Diwa is a great property, but they showed no initiative towards making it a special stay for me and my wife, despite repeated phone calls and requests in person. I definitely do not recommend staying at this property if youre looking to go there for a special occasion. Its got good rooms but lack respect for its guests and have a very stiff approach to doing things.",0
516,"I stayed in this property for 3 days in diva suites. Room is clean and good. You can hear loads of noise in morning time, it has two outside houses in the property. If you request any room service please expect unlimited delays. Cleaning staff will keep ringing the bell until you open the door in frustration. Hotel management is very rude and all good point of property goes in vain due to such experience.",0
517,once u pay money online you have no choice but to accept the room they give normally it is the worst room of the hotel room no 147 n 153 family terrace room what terrace? i pad for one day online n wanted to check out n the manager had the courage to ask the amount for the balance two days i.e for sun n mon nite 13 n 14th july. pity untrained people manning this good property,0
518,"While they have made decent property, but nowhere close to Lila or Tajs of the world. Prices are no cheaper. 
I guess they have forgotten that they operate in hospitality industry. They are RUDE to the core. You can feel it right when you enter the check in. House keeping doesn't respond. So unless you have spare money and time to spend on them, dont even think about it. Services are pathetic.",0
519,"INTRODUCTION
My family and I ( 7 of us including a baby) checked into the hotel on the 16th hoping that we would have a relaxed and chilled out annual family vacation. Little did we know that the staff of the hotel was about to entirely ruin our plan of a relaxed holiday.

ROOM
We had booked the terrace rooms almost a month and half in advance and had been promised excellent service by Asmita who is employed in the bombay office of Alila Diwa Goa. We were taken to the rooms which to our dismay were not even adjoining despite booking well in advance. The rooms are really nice and spacious and this was one out of the three positives that we witnessed in our stay. 

PROPERTY IN GENERAL
Another positive of the trip was the Property as a whole, which is stunningly beautiful. a Specific mention must be made for the Infinity Pool which is really nice.(SECOND POSITIVE) 

FOOD
All our meals were at the Vivo restaurant since we had booked the all meals plan. As we ate dinner we realised that the staff at the restaurant are more interested in clearing crockery instead of providing us with water, finger bowls, etc. on asking them 3-4 times we got water. on our last day we literally had to go and take it ourselves. The food was decent but became really repetitive and so we got bored of it after a point.

EDGE BAR
We went to the bar one night and were given really good service and were very happy with the staff who were polite and courteous. (THIRD POSITIVE)

HOUSEKEEPING
By far the worst experience we've had in terms of housekeeping and staff. We settled down into the room only to find out that one of the rooms had a lizard. On calling the housekeeping they said that there is no lizard and unfortunately it had disappeared by then. on the second day of our stay we found out that the staff just barge into the room and start cleaning it without any instructions. On telling a member of the staff not to do so, he backanswered us and said that it is our duty to inform the hotel that we do not want our room to be cleaned. In one of the rooms the air conditioning also wasnt working and in spite of telling the housekeeping/maintenance to do something about it, nothing was done. The most disturbing part of the stay was that on multiple occasions the housekeeping people just entered the room without ringing the bell in spite of the privacy setting being active, which reflects really badly on the training that the staff has been given. 

SERVICE IN GENERAL
The staff was really laid back and dint serve us promptly at all. We had to call people 3-4 times to clean the room and on the last two days our room keys just stopped working and it took the reception nearly twenty minutes to send replacements to us. The rooms were cleaned only when they felt like cleaning them. Lastly, as the icing on the cake, the day we checked out a wedding group was arriving and hence there was no staff on the reception to even bother seeing us off despite them knowing that we had been treated badly. Hats off to the shamelessness displayed by the Staff of the FIVE STAR PROPERTY Alila Diwa Goa. 
On the whole if you want to stay in a beautiful property with third rate service this is the perfect fit, though I would strongly recommend the Taj properties in the north ( Village and Aguada) or the south (Exotica) as they charge nearly the same amount but offer much better service. 

CONCLUSION
We will never ever go back here to stay and dissuade all those who we know from staying here. 
To those at The Alila reading this review if you'll even do, Thank you so much for destroying our holiday. I sincerely hope you dont do to any other guests what you'll did to us.",0
520,Its been a nightmare trying to book this hotel lets see if and how quick it ges turned around. My view may change into a positive one but so far its been disapointing. Not a great start to our honeymoon experience,0
521,"Had to wait for almost an hour to check in finally we got one room by 4 pm although we booked for 2 . The other room we had to wait for another hour finally when we got the rooms the bathrooms were not cleaned towels not replaced after the previous guest has left absolutely lethargic house keeping department 
The pool when you see in the website is heavenly but is absolute waste and not maintained hygienically 
For sight seeing we were asked to approach the travel desk which was blissfully empty and finally the reception arranged a taxi 
The so called library has less than 10 books 
Absolutely lethargic service in the restaurants 
Absolute waste of time and money anybody who has value for thier money or time should never visit this place ",0
522,"It was a destination wedding 200 rooms booked and service and promises were all broken .
Never ever visit such a place where the new rooms are the only attraction. 
No one seems to be charge ,all requests were met with a firm not possible ,early check in no ,late check out no .pool dip 20 minutes past time ,no .car availability no .
Some one in Delhi sitting there calls the shots ,still have not managed to find out who actually runs this place",0
523,"Sub standard food and service. Had all meals inclusive but poor quality of food. 
The bread counter was closed in lunch hours and took more than half an hour to bring Indian breads when we were done with our meal. 
They made egg pancakes along with vegetarian dosa saying both are same

524,"We stayed at Alila Diwa Goa in May 2012. We landed in Goa early and reached the hotel by 6 a.m. and were promptly shown to our room. 

When we entered the room (341), my wife noticed that the floor was dirty so we requested that the room be cleaned. 

While we were waiting for the room to be cleaned, my wife opened one of the draws and pulled at what she thought was a hair dryer - not only did the hair dryer pull back but it was also furry. She pulled away with a shriek. The rat in the draw (which was one fat bugger) was moving around slowly. By this time the attendant came back to the room and when we told him that there was a rat in the draw, he promptly opened the draw and started shooting a video on his mobile - this would have made us furious if it wasn't so ridiculous. I also snapped a pic of the rat (see pics)!

We called the manager, who was unavailable as he was on Holiday. The Assistant Manager came to meet us and upgraded us to a suite in the Diwa Wing (no big deal) and offered us complimentary breakfast (which was a part of our package anyway!!). The rest of the stay was uneventful. 

Other than the big [--] rat, following are my thoughts on the property: 
(A) The Property looks very good - not really a five star though;
(B) Breakfast is good; 
(C) The Diwa Wing Pool is very nice; 
(D) Close to Martin's Corner - so you needn't worry about eating good food; 
(E) Quite a distance from the beach (not a pleasant walk in Goa heat) - the hotel organizes and pick up and drop though. 

Our experience at Alila is a stark contrast to the other hotel experiences that we have had in Goa - where we have more often than not been wowed by the rooms and the service.",0
525,"Checked into the hotel, yesterday, and realised this morning that we were burgled from our rooms.

The thief has walked into my room and stolen my bag from inside the room, emptied the contents outside in the lawn and taken 20,000 INR (approx). we also lost 10,000 INR (approx) from inside the room which were placed at the head side table. 

We complained to the staff at 10:30 AM (approx) and they are still 'investigating'. 2 more rooms were burgled last night. 

The police was called after 5 hours, and they refuse to show us the camera footage. 

The junior staff takes the call, because they have NO Manager Incharge. The Duty Manager is on Vacation. (HOW CONVINIENT?!?) 

It took the staff over 2 hours to hand is our room keys when we checked in, to share feedback about small things.

We were planning to stay for 2 nights but instead we are checking out NOW.

An AVOIDABLE place for a holiday.",0
526,"If you are into Russians, deck chairs reserved throughout the day by towels, cantina style food and seating this is your place. While the staff is generally helpful and friendly and the rooms are noisy but sort of okay, the Alila Diwa Goa experience leaves me with one wish: beam we home.",0
527,"after getting a good review from a friend. i decided to book this place for our 1st marriage anniversary. in our online booking form i had mentioned that this will be our first anniversary stay and request if they can book a cake for us (at extra cost thats fine) and since we are checking out on our anniversary day, request if we can get a late check out by 4 hrs. I must have mentioned this line several times in the communication with the hote ""THIS IS A SURPRISE for my husband""

after landing at the hotel, property is beautiful no doubt about it. the first thing that the front desk staff is asking my husband ""sir when would you like to have the cake"". We land at the hotel on 19th May and our anniversary was on 21st May......even a kid can guess when we would like to have the cake. a night prior to our anniversary i take my husband out and requested the hotel staff to keep the cake in the room so that still i can keep up to my plan of surprise. The front desk lady calls my husband and asks "" SIR we have not arranged your cake can we get that tomorrow morning"".

what level of service is this???????

last point on our request for late check out? after informing the front desk staff atleast 10 times....they pretend that they were not aware of any such request made by us where i have a written proof of this request being made.

are you kidding me that this is a 5 star property. no wonder you are not able to retain your customers.

well you can visit this place as the properly is awesome. but dont expect a 5 star level staff service.",0
528,"To say this is a 5 star Hotel should not only depend on the hotel and facilities but should also focus on service, to which there is none. If you are considering traveling to this hotel you should make sure that you do not stay over the holiday periods as they also use the hotel as a wedding venue for very large weddings and therefore any holiday guests that are staying are in the minority. During our 8 day stay the hotel was taken over by 3-400 wedding guests for six different weddings. On each occasion parts of the hotel are shut off to holiday guests such as one of the pools and one or two of the restaurant's depending on what time of the day it is.  We had to move rooms on four occasions depending on what part of the Hotel had been hired out for the wedding as this changed from the bar to the main pool then to the lawn area or maybe all three areas at different times of the day. 
I have been travelling to many different countries over the years and I have never experienced such a terrible mistreatment of hotel guests I think I can speak on behalf of the very few guests that were staying there at the same time as us by saying we all felt that we were treated like 2nd class citizens and that the wedding guests were the most important people to the Hotel. Do not spend your hard earned money staying here find somewhere that is actually a 5 star as this resort is not!",0
529,"I would give Alila Goa the hotel and it's staff five stars but.....an otherwise amazing hotel experience has been marred by hordes of extremely loud Indian wedding celebrations. I have never been to a ""beach"" holiday that was as ""untranquil"" as this one. My first impression was ""wow"" and Until our last day I thought that the management sort of tried to keep the full paying hotel guests a little shielded, but on our last day at breakfast it was like a fish market with incredibly loud drums and shouting all over the place. In front of our amazing room were Indian guests shouting from one end of the corridor to the other. This hotel is truly paradise if not for the management allowing such behavior and noise.
Thank you though to the exceptional restaurant and pool staff.",0
530,"Had booked a 2 bedrooms suite (which is a scam!). First, we got the room at 4:30pm! We literally had to go in the room and pressurise them to hurry with the cleaning. Room interiors looked old, floor had stains and it pretty much looked like 2 interconnecting rooms (1 suite and 1 deluxe room). While we were waiting for the room in the reception we were asked to go for our meal. With only 2 tables occupied, it took an HOUR to serve our meal (im guessing this was done to buy time). 
When we did go to our room, there was just ONE person cleaning the entire suite. We wanted to talk to the hotel manager, but never got him. First the on duty manager was sent (who could hardly speak english), then the housekeeping manager (who was speechless) and finally the Director of rooms (couldnt do much). Even tho she said she would personally take care of us, we didnt see her for the remaining part of our stay.
even in the restaurants we had few issues over the period or our stay. 
Overall it was a horrendous experience that we have ever faced.",0
531,"I've staying here before and first time was very nice as a lot of nice places in Goa. This trip I arrived at 11:30am only to have to wait till 3:30 for my room. No apologizes and I went to the front desk three times only to be told ""it's not ready"". My main beef was when I required to rent a car with driver for a work meeting and asked 3 times to have an all day car driver, that way I could come out of my meeting and the car would be there. I believe they had no drivers or needed more as I was told they could drop me off and I could get a cab at meeting. I said a few times, so I can get a cab there and was told yes, yes again and yes again. AND, I came out of my meeting and NO cabs and had my meeting colleagues call and could only get Ailia Diwi to come back to pick me up, which is exactly as I did not want. I waiting in there office for over 45 minutes, wasting my time and was not happy. I was lied to as I think they had a low number of drivers and missed the sunset and beers at the shack on the beach and singlehandedly put the front desk person for my missed opportunity of a fun evening. Not the hotels fault but I was awoken at 2:30am from a loud group drinking and listening to music as my room was right over the pool. Had to call staff to assist and they did. So, I feel bratty for writing the above but I just have a bad taste in my mouth from the trip......",0
532,"Visited with family..we had 4 rooms.
The quality of the food at the Alila Diwa is horrible. I have never had such bad food at the resort. I tried all the 3 restaurants- Vivo, Spice & Bistro and it was appaling that the food can be this bad. After that we ended up eating outside the resort where the food was much better.
Also the staff at the resort is completely untrained. If you need anything in the room you wont get it unless you call 5 times & yell at them. One day i had to wait 30min at the pool for towels. The staff was completely clueless about where the towels will come from. There is absolutely no coordination & communication between the staff. Also the towels & sheets in the rooms are dirty & you need to tell them for clean linen. The pool area is nice but the food and service is so poor that its better to avoid this property. There are much better properties in Goa & elsewhere!!",0
533,"My wife and I stayed for 3 Nights at the Alila Diwa. Had previously stayed here in 2014 and loved the place, so choosing this hotel irrespective of the reviews was a no-brainer for us. Unfortunately, this time around we were rudely shocked. Property is beautiful, but one can see the 'newness' wearing out. Wooden flooring was creaky at many places and multiple stones on their long corridors looked cracked. Sad sight but not a deal breaker. Reason we would choose Alila over a Taj / Hyatt was their impeccable hospitality. Unfortunately, not so anymore. The staff has changed. Staff still has their heart at the right place but are just not trained properly or in some cases simply incompetent. Being an Indian, on many occasions, I was finding it difficult to communicate with the staff. 

On arrival, we were welcomed warmly by Nigel, who very nicely showed us all the available options. Thorough-bred gentleman. 

But post that experience, it went downhill. After a arduous drive from Pune, we wanted to relax but were disturbed by 4 phone calls for 4 different reasons. 
Anyway, everything can be forgiven, but in a few moments after the barrage of phone calls, a gentleman from housekeeping walks straight into our room whilst the privacy sign was On. Sorry guys, but something like this simply unpardonable!! 

On complaining about this incident, a Jr Asst Manager threw us a bone in the form of a free dinner 'but please pay for your beverages.' Anyway, I am sure this was the best he was authorised to do. 

The breakfast buffet was below par, practically the same for all 3 days except for a few twists in the potato / grilled fish. 

All in all failed to impress. I think Alila is now interested in catering to corporate affairs / weddings etc. Why else would your mini bar snacks include a Good-day biscuit and Haldiram?? Very sad to see such a beautiful property deteriorating so rapidly. 

Word of caution: Please make sure to ask whether there are any corporate events / weddings before checking in. If yes, choose another hotel as the facilities such as pool / bar are taken over and you end up in the midst of a unpleasant noisy environment!

Will I stay again? I might because I still can't get the fond memories of 2014 out of my head.",0
534,"Yes it boasts of good rooms and a pretty swimming pool. But 15k for a night! Tht too in off season. Just not happening guys.

The spa is 5000 for a 1 hour massage. Even hotels like taj and hyatt are cheaper than this. I would definitely recommend to avoid this place. 

But for guys with lots of cash. Huh! Hv a blast.

Stayed March 2016, travelled as a couple",0
535,"I have just returned home having spent 2 weeks at Alila Diwa. I have to say I have struggled writing this review. The hotel has quite a few good points, conversely however it has quite a few bad points.
First and foremost, the thing that really makes this hotel is the staff. Every single member of staff from the driver who picked me up at the airport through the gardeners, the cleaners, the bar staff, reception staff, restaurant staff, were, without exception friendly, helpful, cheerful and a real credit to the hotel.

Now, allow me to quote a couple of adjectives used on the hotel website 'serenity', 'tranquil courtyards'. In addition this hotel features as a Thomson A La Carte hotel. I have to say my expectations were high.

I was sorely disappointed. 

It appears to me that Alila Diwa caters for the Tourist market as a sideline. What this hotel is, is a conference and events destination. There is something quite disconcerting about being surrounded by 100 plus conference delegates (a recent review quotes 220 delegates, this happened the day before I left), in the dining room and then having the tranquil mood around the pool invaded by a large group of them playing games in the pool screaming and shouting at each other. 
In addition to the large number of people attending conferences at the hotel during my stay the Sunday lunch is apparently open to paying visitors should they wish to come along. A large group of English visitors paid their money and invaded the serenity of the pool area on my second Sunday. Without a word of exaggeration all that was needed was Madge in a gold motability scooter to appear and it really would have been like being on the set of Benidorm.

Don't get me wrong, when the hotel is being used by paying holiday guests only it really is a haven of tranquillity. When the restaurant is not full of conference delegates the atmosphere is exceptional. 

I know the tourist market is tough at the moment but the hotel really need to address how they cater for paying holiday guests and how they can be kept apart from conference and events guests.

The rooms at the hotel are really rather comfortable. I loved the open plan design. They are kept spotless by the efficient cleaning staff and their managers. I have never seen three people cleaning one room. Magnificent!!

The Vivo restaurant serves a mix of different foods from around the world. Indian, Chinese, Italian. Somewhat rather unusual for a buffet restaurant all the food was piping hot. A special thanks must go to Subrata one of the waiters in the restaurant and also to the manager Shubhay. Both of these guys really are exceptional at what they do. Always a friendly greeting using my name, always happy to offer something that is not on the menu (loved the cheese and onion naan). Thanks guys.

I paid one visit to the Spice Studio but had an unfortunate experience there that I won't dwell on.

The best place to eat at the hotel has got to be The Bistro. The food there was beyond anything I had expected to experience in India. It really is a 'fine dining' experience.

The Edge bar offers a great place to have a relaxed pre-dinner drink (when the pool is not being invaded by conference delegates). I've become a fan of the Indian Merlot they serve and the Mojitos are just mind blowing. 

If you're thinking of booking Alila Diwa or have already booked be prepared to share you holiday experience with conference delegates and people attending sundry other events at the hotel. 

I wouldn't book again, but that's my personal choice. As I said previously when the hotel is being used by paying holiday guests only it really is a haven of tranquillity. Unfortunately the hotels main business interfered with and spoilt my holiday. To their credit the management at the hotel did address my concerns whilst I was there and they are to be applauded for this, especially Chadwick. It just seemed that as they addressed one issue another one arose or another large group arrived for a conference.",0
536,"This is our third time staying at this hotel. 
The staff are attentive, pool boys, waiters and housekeeping. Breakfasts are good with variety of dishes. Rooms are well arranged and air-con quiet. Infinity pool is great, cart to beach usually efficient.
During our stay at this hotel there were two weddings which lasted three days each, one was massive, also two conferences. During these times there were changes of restaurants, unable to use the infinity pool for three days.(you could use club pool, but it is not what we were expecting). Times you were using the pool there would be a construction of an area ready for the next part of the celebration. Not very peaceful.
When the celebration started it would have loud music playing.
Also the taxi drivers we encountered acted like thugs! We use a local guy for taxis, one day we returned in a taxi, decided to have a drink at bar across the road as we were crossing the hotel drivers were hassling our driver. My husband asked what the problem was and at this the hotel driver verbally attacked him, then went to physically attack him, at this point the security guards stepped in to protect him! We reported this to the hotel , they investigated this incident but were told he denied it, although four of us were present plus hotel security. Would never use these taxis in any circumstances.
Also we did feel the constant weddings were intrusive but as management pointed out they need the different functions to survive in business because of the falling number of foreign tourists
We have been visiting Goa for nearly twenty years but the charm of the area has diminished to such an extent we probably will not visit again.",0
537,"I first went to Alila Diwa in August as part of a conference group on a full meal plan. The experience and property was lovely, so we decided to do a family holiday during the Diwali week on a continental plan. The experience was just not up to the mark
1. The front desk is not geared up. Check out took a long time and the staff was struggling with the credit card machine
2. The restaurant for a la carte. Dinner time with a la carte was a mess. They were short-staffed, the orders took a lot of time, the billing was off, the soup came after the main course, etc. 
3. Breakfast buffet. When items would get over, it would take a long time for them to be replaced. 
4. Buggy to the beach. There is at least a 9-12 gap between the floor of the buggy and the ground. My mom who is 76 and has trouble climbing just could not climb in or out without two people holding and supporting her. We asked for a small stool or platform multiple times, but no escalation and no one was bothered. 
5. We had booked two taxis to take us to the airport. I had reconfirmed multiple times, but there was utter confusion at the time we were supposed to get the taxis. 
6. Though subtle there was a bias towards non-Indians, who formed the large majority of guests. 
On the plus side, the staff is ever-smiling, and when not stressed, helpful and supportive",0
538,"Great hotel, but poor experience with Thompson holidays 

We travel a lot and can compare from experience. We usually pay more so we can relax and unwind in the best there is. Never having been to Goa before, we liked the marketing from Tompson on this 5 star resort. 

Flight:

This is a trip on the 787 Dreamliner where two passengers behind us nearly got to fighting over luggage space, where those in ear shot would have heard the man and woman telling other to 'F off'. No further issues from them but then I encountered what has to have been the rudest member of cabin crew in 40 years of long haul. 

My wife and I were in Premium on Tom124 at the very front. The issue was with a female member of the crew (I didn't get her name) but she wasn't permanently stationed there. She kept nipping down for a chat to her colleagues in the front galley - no issues with that.

Instead of asking if we could use the left side to access the toilets (I was in 1F and it meant walking over bags or all way round) she twice failed to utter a single word and instead, actually outstared me when I asked very politely to get past. On the second time when walking through and back to my seat, she did not move, leaving it difficult to squeeze past and then once I got through, she 'gestured' her disgust by 'slamming' shut the curtain. I'm not being funny but without a sign saying ""crew only"", if someone doesn't simply ask you, then the money-paying customer should not be left feeling chastised and embarrassed.

Hotel:

At first, very happy. The room is large and well laid out with the usual 5 star touches like a choice of nice shampoos etc, robes, slippers etc. Some bulbs were out and as always, there were not enough coat hangers or hanging space (we ended up leaving the cases out with clothes in (there really is little hanging space). The safe is also very awkward to get to in the clothes cupboard and fitted the wrong way around meaning you actually have to get in to the wardrobe and sit on the shelf to put the code in. So, five stars, I'm not sure based on the detail (yes, the problem if you've done 5 star in places like Dubai). Maybe we're spoilt but stars are stars and the same build detail should apply worldwide. 

The staff we met were really very nice and attentive. Their English was excellent and seriously nothing was too much trouble. Now, this did not apply everywhere. In the high quality Bistro pool bar, the staff fail every time to actually see you walking to a table and sitting waiting for a drink - ten minutes it takes on average and in the main, there were only two other couples there. There are around six members of staff on duty plus a Manager and they all seem to be doing something other than serving the customer. It happened every day without fail - in fact it's as if they are not part of the main hotel and almost like it's been franchised off to a cheapskate company. 

Weddings

I don't recall Tompson warning us that this was a hotspot Indian wedding venue. Had I had known, we would NOT have booked. The guests who were in the next room to us had come down for one of the weddings and like any self-respecting party reveller, they gave the ball a kick. Until 4:00am on Sunday they really were at full volume, ringing who ever they could at the top of their voice, with the TV blaring out, walking out on to the veranda every ten minutes to actually spit over on to the gardens. Not something you want to hear at the best of times and certainly not while trying get to sleep. We reported this next morning and the Duty Manager was very sympathetic and apologised. We said we never want that again and he said he would ensure our new neighbours would be quieter. They were, but alas the wedding they were attending was not!

All day from lunchtime today, the sedate venue of this beautiful location with lush surroundings, amazing affinity pools, Palm trees and paddy fields has been converted in to Ibiza, with music so loud, you could not shout to be heard. The sub bass levels like I had never heard before certainly started to make me feel sick. No matter where you went in the extensive grounds, you could not escape the 120 BPM for over five hours. I love loud music but this WAS TOO LOUD - to the point of it being treated as sound pollution.

By 6:00pm and the music has stopped. I chose not complain again, as it was getting boring for everyone. 

When it came to check out, because the flight was early morning, the contract for each of the several Brits on this package was to receive an 11:00pm check out. When we were asked to meet the day before to do the briefing, the local Thomson Rep said this was not true and it was a ""misprint"". We all showed proof and said, this was not possible and had to vacate our rooms by lunchtime. We complained and Tweeted but Thomson were useless. That said, the hotel Manager was fantastic and came to everyone's rescue to allow us to have use of a spare room each. Although it was inconvenient, it prevented us all from sitting fully clothed with no private facilities. Well done Alila Daiwa, rubbish service Thomson. 

Nothing came of this, except after three months when Thomson rang me to see if I was happy that my complaint was sorted. I explained we at the time was never compensated for the breach of contract, or the loss of a day in the hotel. The Customer Services call was quite literally a waste of time and would have been better not having been made at all. Useless!

Sorry to bang on about this, but seriously, this has put us off returning to the same hotel and we both vowed never to use Thomson Holidays again.",0
539,"Me and my husband usually travel to Goa for short breaks. We have stayed more or less try different hotels. This time we went for 3 days stay so first day we stayed at Deltin suites ( however there was lot of crowd) and we wanted peaceful holiday so we decided to move out.My friends suggested to go to Alila Goa for remaining stay . It was a weekend and I contacted someone who could book us in. Gentleman called me and advised they that the reservation is confirmed for 2 nights. First night on All meal plan and second on Half board plan ( Breakfast plus one major meal). When reached the hotel reception I was surprised that the lady ( Front office Manager) offered us to stay at the Diwa Club section instead of the regular room (superior /exceutive ) we booked for. I assumed it was due to the good relation I shared with the Gentleman that we got upgraded. However Front office Lady subtly put across that there is a wedding group in house and for next three days it is going to be buzz and hence they want us to stay at the Diwa end ( so that we don't get disturbed). I was happy that at least they considered our privacy and didn't spoil our peace. She briefed us about breakfast at the Diwa club , but for lunch and Dinner ( we had to visit their restaurant which was common for wedding crowd). To my surprise the buffet on 1st day had only one non veg dish. I called the chef to know why they didn't have much choice and he answered abruptly the day India has higher Non vegetarian preference we will have much choice. It sounded Kidish . The entire restaurant staff was busy serving the wedding group that we waited for 15 minutes and 3 reminders to get a glass of water ....I thought we made a wrong choice staying at this property.
We were briefed about the mini theatre and movie at 9pm. So we decided not to move out of the hotel ( just relax) and watch a movie at the mini theatre. To my surprise again , I found the Wedding group sitting in the mini theatre and getting their Mehendi done. They told us you may watch the movie ( but how can you watch with all lights ON). We immediately went to the reception and confronted the Duty manager ( asking him that he could have informed us about this mehendi arrangement in advance so that we wouldn't have wasted our evening waiting , instead would have moved out in the evening.
However he apologised and advised the following night he will take care. It wouldn't happen.
So the second day saga - We have a good late breakfast at the Diwa side. 
We roamed around and slept and skipped (paid ) lunch. We stepped out late evening for dinner . Again the restaurant was crowded with wedding grip tables weren't set and we had to look around again for a glass of water . Since my husband was hungry, we didn't bother to wait we went to the buffet .... again sad non veg dish .....as soon as my hubby had his first bite ....surprise surprise ..he found a plastic strap in his food ( one that are tied to chicken legs). He was furious and we called for the F &B Manager. He apologised and advised that Chef will see us. We actually felt this is a disaster and things are going worst for us. We then met the chef and a dedicated restaurant guy was allotted to take care of us. All of them consoled us about our bitter experience at the property .
They also asked why didn't the Duty manager offer a DVD player last night instead of asking you to wait until next day. I didn't have any answer.
it took two days for the team to realise that our holiday was getting spoiled , ( Unfortunately due to non availability of return tickets we were forced to extend our stay by a night) I was very skeptical , but my hubby didn't want to move out as we had a next day early morning 5:45 am flight) we didn't bother to ask anything any further. Staff was good. 
I felt things could have been managed well. If one is going to relax and spend a peaceful holiday , first enquire there are no groups also as customers we expect HOTEL to be more equipped to manage such situations.
But I wonder why didn't GM bother to meet us . In spite of several critical incidents happening with the guest GM didn't bother. I wonder what was he busy with ?",0
540,"My husband and I were there in February, in the brochure it stated there was entertainment every night but in fact there was the same CD playing every night for 2 weeks apart from 1 night when they showed The Sound Of Music!!!!!! It also stated that snacks would be served by the pool until midnight but that was not the case either, there was the occasional bowl of nuts. we certainly loved the hotel but wouldn't say its ideal for all inclusive. The staff were all very friendly and the hotel was lovely but sad to say we will not be returning to this one very expensive and not a la carte.",0
541,"About 6 couples decide to go for the weekend here....The food standard was not as expected....when we ordered Burger and fries...the fries didn't come...reason as the waiter had told us ""The gas got over,so couldn't make fries""
When we complained about the other food,waiters tell us that our taste buds are wrong and everyone else appreciate it.
Never coming again to this hotel for food,
Only worth thing at this hotel is the pool.",0
542,"We stayed at Alila Diwa Goa for 2 nights at a Family Suite. Both Agoda and Alila's websites say ""lush paddy views"" but our room overlooks a rooftop with no field - lush or not lush - in sight. When I brought the matter to the site manager Mr. Chanwick, he said view is subjective. We could not agree with him as looking out to an ugly rooftop is obviously inferior to what was promised. He then argued that the better rooms are reserved for long-stay customers. If that is the case then it should be specified that view is subject to availability. When we asked what he could do to help Mr. Chanwick said the hotel was full (which didn't seem so) and he only has one room with view. The choice he gave us was either to squeeze the 3 of us from a Family suite into a standard room, or, we have to take a second room with extra charges. We found both choices unacceptable and after much time wasted, Mr. Chanwick said the best he could do was to offer us sunset drinks. We refused to accept that as it didn't even seem like a sincere offer to rectify the situation. 

I think the biggest problem here is not just the misleading room description on Alila website, but a stubborness to deny an error and unwillingness to help.",0
543,"This was the place in India that I was most looking forward to staying, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Firstly, our room was fantastic, but there was no hot water in the bath after the first night. I contacted reception on several occasions, but it was never looked at. 

Secondly, many of the staff seemed to be handing around for tips, not something you would expect when staying in a resort costing the amount it did. 

However, I do need to give credit where it is due. Movil who cleaned our room was different, he was efficient and did his job well. He was very hard working.

Thirdly, if we wanted an extra bed in the room four our children it was going to cost and extra 2500 rupees per night, around $50 AUD. When paying over $200 AUD per night, this is not acceptable. They did provide the linen, at no extra cost, for one child to sleep on the couch. 

Fourthly, the laundry costs were more than double the cost of what other hotels we stayed at charged. The staff had difficult in costing the children's clothing right. When I pressed this issue, it was corrected with and overall discount. 

Finally, staying at the Alila Diwa isolates you to using the taxi service engaged by Alila Diwa. The service is a huge rip off. When I asked for a car that was not going to rip me off, they produced a price list. I was told the vehicles are cleaner and larger. To have a car take me to Margoa was going to cost me 1000 rupees one way. Yet another vehicle the same model and size, not linked with the resort, would do a return trip and wait for me for two hours in Margoa for 600 rupees. The hotel vehicle would only wait 1 hour. There were other destinations that we were quoted by the hotel 800 rupees that an alternative taxi (same size and model) would charge 300 rupees for. The drivers associated with the Alila Diwa still expected a tip. Due to the location of the resort you cannot just walk out onto the street and get an alternative taxi. You need to walk up to the main road, which takes 15-30 minutes. We found a regular driver while in Goa, but he could not pick us up from the resort, we had to meet him elsewhere. In the end, he had to drop us off nearby as he was given a hard time by the resort staff. This treatment of our chosen driver really upset me. 

Our room was comfortable, the resort was clean, the gardens beautiful, the pool was fantastic, there was a free courtesy vehicle to the beach and the breakfast food was fantastic. It was the other things that left me feeling I was constantly being ripped off that made the Alila Diwa the worst place we stayed while in India.",0
544,"location of the hotel is fine, rooms are good, food is also fine, but the staff at the reception is lacks courtesy of a 5 star. We booked 2 rooms by make my trip.com. At the time of check in on monday we reached hotel at 1.30 pm had to wait as the check in time was 3.00 pm. We requested them if they could give even one room as my parents and kids were along they kept us waiting saying rooms not yet ready. At 3.00 pm finally we were provided only one room. Finally got the other rooms only by around 3.30pm. As my flight was at 4 pm tuesday i requested check out at 2.00 pm instead of 12.00, they kept saying we will try, we will try and at 11.45 they said sorry no rooms available. At that point i had to raise my voice and threaten them about the late check out complaint, at that time i had to force them to provide at least 1 room for stay upto 2.00 pm. then we 5 people spent 2 hrs in one room. overall dealing with reception staff was not a easy task. Looked like bargaining in flea market.",0
545,V went in a big group here on the 15th August weekend..the hotel is a small property with average rooms..they conned us with the name of family terrace rooms being bigger and better than the terrace rooms..we payed the extra amount and then saw they were same kind of rooms more or less..the buffet food was pathetic every time..only the ice creams were good in the whole spread of buffet..for the tariffs that we payed here..I think we could hv got better properties..,0
546,"The property is very nice and the interiors are great, but there is nothing else which is good about the hotel. Though the interiors were good, but everything is designed in a very complicated manner, specially light switches. You will have to spend some time to understand how they fucntion.
We had gone there, on the long weekend of 15th August 2014 and the hotel was fully occupied, but they did not have sufficient staff to cater to all the guest. Service was very slow and the quality of food was pathetic.
During buffet, one had to stand in long queues at live counters to get the food made of their choice. The Buffet spread was very bad and there were hardly any dishes which were good in taste.
I would suggest other places in goa over Alila Diwa, as they do not have, what a lot of other hotels in goa would offer. The beach was not walkable, one had to take a shuttle from the hotel, everytime one wants to go to the beach. They did not have any tie ups with any car hire places, i. e. if you want to hire a self driven car, you dont have any option. There is no such option available nearby also, if you want to explore such options on your own. We had a drop facility to the airport as a part of our package, but they delayed that also because they were so disorganized. Some of the positive points about the hotel would be that they gave quite good discount vouchers as a part of our deal. But I would not reccomend this place to anyone visiting goa...",0
547,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my husband for a business-cum-family trip during monsoon. We had booked Alila Diwa room, however the hotel upgraded us to Diwa Club (Nice). The hotel is competitively priced compared to other 5 star properties in Goa. The welcome process is quick and refreshing. The property looks amazing until you cross the Alila Diwa gardens and get to know that the Diwa Club is surrounded with so many residential houses. They have two residential houses within the property (and we found residential people driving bikes randomly). The rooms are quite nice and big, with a modern style bathroom, however the view from room is busy residential houses and not a Goa'n view. They have quite a few restaurants; with just like any another hotel food options. If you are in Goa for beach or beach view you need to walk for 10 mins to reach there from this hotel. They claim to have frequent shuttle services, that is not so frequent. We woke up in the morning with a lot of residential house noise, and found their restaurant super busy to get some breakfast to make up the morning. To avoid hassle, we tried ordering food in the room other day, for which room service never cleared the plate (even after requesting them over a call). The check out process is very painful too! We requested them for half an hour extension to check out, because of obvious odd flight times and they were very strict about not extending it (as the hotel was busy). When we arrived at the reception, it was very sad to know, that they were happy to give exception to many other guest for an hour and two. My only bit is, you can get better hotels at this rate; like Taj Exotica, Hyatt and Lalit, which can offer you great service and experience. It's all about service and experience when you prefer south Goa to spend your holidays.",0
548,"We stayed in Alila Diwa from 15th March to 18th March (Me, My Wife, 2 Kids - 5 yr / 6 months old)

Good: The property is nice, rooms are of good size. Pool is very nice. Best part is Kids area - lot of activities for the kids. My daughter loved it.
The hotel is about 1km away from sea, but they've regular shuttle going to the sea. 

Bad: But our stay was spoilt by two aspects : terrible service, and issue with lift. On the service front, we faced challenge at cafeteria. Long lines at each counter, and hotel frequently ran out of stuff. Curd was finished on Day1, and ran out of paranthas on Day2.

Ugly: Biggest issue we faced was lift. We were given room on 2nd floor. On 15th evening itself, lift stopped working, while we were inside lift. Had to wait for 15 minutes, for someone to come, open the lift manually, and rescue us out. After this incident, they installed a notice in front of lift that lift not working. From Day1 evening to Day3 morning, lift was not working, and we had to climb up and down manually (with 6 months kid, and a pram in tow - very challenging). I informed this to management team, but no action. On Day3, lift started working. We used it once, and again we all got stuck. Someone had to come and rescue us manually after 10 minutes!! We again raise issue to management, but no action, other than apology! Ofcourse, after this experience, we didn't use the lift at all, and checked out the next morning.
In service industry, problem can come in any area. Running hotel is a complex challenge. But how a good hotel differentiate itself is putting customer first, and prompt response/action on issues. Not only there were recurrent issues faced, but we didn't see any tangible action happening from management. Very disappointing stay.",0
549,"Our experience with the hotel was bad from the check in, we had to wait endlessly as there was check out of wedding guests. We were booked in the club Diwa where we paid 16k per nite. The only good hing was we were apart from the main wing, had our own pool. The food is average but service pathetic. No waiters would even look at you to offer to serve you. The cleanliness of the rooms were below avg. At bistro we asked for apple juice and were never served , ultimately we left bistro and were still charged for it. The check out was pathetic again , car not on time inspire of promising us that coach would be available at the agreed hour. Wrongly charged mini bar bill was another woe. The receptionist , Shaheen was laid back in her approach, (not even a smile on her face from day one)and took ages to waive off the said amount until we intervened and told her we were late for our flight. All in all just not worth 16 k a nite.its more of a wedding destination, they host weddings at least once a week. This kinda service, cleanliness and attitude is not expected from a five star hotel. We had just spent 4 nights prior to here at grand Hyatt and the difference was clearly visible.",0
550,"The Hotel is beautifull, but its beauty is chipped away as your holiday goes on. They mainly cater for the Indian weddings in this hotel and you are pushed to one side, The pool will be out of bounds the resturants closed and even if you can go in the pool you will be over run by small children that are allowed to run riot. Peace is shattered.The weddings held here go on for 2-3 days so its not just a one off, People got so fed up of being turned away that they ate out (the shacks outside are lovely!) so when the wedding finished there wasnt any one in the resturant. They then closed the resturant , not funny when your full board!!
If you were Indian the service in this hotel was fantastic.",0
551,"Seriously. A mess. A beautiful property nearly ruined by some truly inexplicable service and business decisions.

Unfortunately, our very first impressions set the tone for what would turn out to be a very strange resort experience.

Upon arrival in Goa, we had arranged to be met by a car and driver from the hotel. We exit the terminal, and survey the sea of drivers holding signs  but no sign with our name, no sign with the Alila Diwa logo. My husband walks around a bit trying to find someone. No luck. He heads back into the terminal to try to find help, where he finds a very nice guy who manages to track down a rep from the hotel. He searches for our name on the list of the days expected arrivals. Nothing. He pulls out a cell phone and calls the hotel, and has a long conversation with someone else who had never heard of us either, despite the fact that I had booked this stay months in advance and was holding in my hand a hard copy of our reservation complete with confirmation number. Nope. No idea who we are. At this point my husband and I were both fuming. (As it happens, I had also come down with a sinus infection and was feeling awful, so this was not helping.) He hands the cell phone to my husband, who gets nowhere, but they do finally agree to pay for a cab to take us to the hotel  still no promise of a room, but at least we will be able to negotiate with someone face-to-face.

We arrive at the hotel, and naturally we are loaded for bear  but as soon as we get out of the car a manager comes over saying everything was figured out and they have our room and here's some juice! All is well! OK! Great....except...What is that crazy LOUD music? ""Oh! That's a wedding! he explains. They're having a pool party so it will be like this for the next few hours...You won't hear it by your room though!""

Ummmm...Not exactly the peace and quiet we had been looking for, but if we can't hear it near our room in the Diwa Wing....

We arrive at our room. It is a beautiful suite  large, comfortable, tastefully decorated. Its in the Diwa Wing, which is about a five minute walk from the main part of the hotel, but we can still hear the music! We are lucky enough to have stayed in many resorts around the world, of many different levels of service and price range. If you travel enough, it is inevitable that occasionally you will stay at a resort that has a wedding or other event taking place. Were pretty easy going people  really! We are! We can make allowances! But we have never, ever, experienced this level of noise and disruption. We would later learn after talking to several members of the staff that this hotel is a HUGE wedding destination. Which is fine, but NOT at the expense of the
enjoyment of other guests  especially when you market yourself as a serene resort where you can enjoy an intimate couples retreat where relaxation reigns. We couldn't even sit and read at the Diwa Wing pool. It was that loud. Not cool, Alila Diwa. (And, it could have been much worse. As it turned out, this was just a party - the actual wedding ceremonies and banquet were taking place somewhere else.)

Now, as to the service Perhaps the kindest way to describe nearly every interaction with a staff member would be Well meaning, but awkward. After we checked in, we were puzzled to find that the room had almost none of the amenities you would expect. No shower gel, no body cream, no hand soap for the sink by the toilet - you know, the standard stuff you find in hotel rooms marketing themselves in the luxury category! We asked for some extra soap 3 times before any were delivered. To their credit, they did finally apologize, and from then on the housekeeper made a point of creating some genuinely cute towel animals each night, which was nice.

In the restaurants, the servers all seemed very nervous and unsure of the fundamentals of their jobs. If you asked for coffee when sitting down for breakfast, it wouldn't come until the end of the meal. If you wanted to find a waiter, even though the restaurant was nearly empty, it would feel like a real-life game of Wheres Waldo?

Breakfast in the Diwa Wing's Bistro could be OK, but our advice: Stick to eggs. Pancakes were like glue and, when my husband made the mistake of ordering the crepes, they arrived raw  perhaps no one had ever actually ordered them before, and the cook was unaware that they were supposed to be cooked? Who knows, but Yuck! On the other hand, the one night we had dinner in the Bistro, the food was quite nice and the friendly executive chef a joy to chat with. 

Dinner in the Spice Studio was also very good and the lovely manager was helpful with giving advice on unusual menu choices and such. We also enjoyed the house made pickles (the garlic!!) and mini lesson on Indian spices!

On the other hand, the resorts approach to room service was beyond peculiar. We wanted to order some of that tasty Indian food to our room for dinner one night, but there was no menu in the room. So we asked for menus at the front desk  and it was like pulling teeth. After several attempts, miscommunications, and negotiations, we finally figured out that since we were staying in the Diwa Wing part of the hotel, we could only have food from the Bistro menu delivered to our room. Huh? At times, it felt like the Diwa Wing was being operated as a separate property from the rest of the resort.

Although the resort itself is well taken care of, and the grounds are lovely, we found the decor of the room a bit sterile. The vast white walls screamed out for some art; the illuminated nooks were obviously meant to hold flowers or sculptures or something  but were empty. Both pools are beautiful, but the annoying pop music coming from the bar made it nearly impossible to truly relax or read when using the pool by the main part of the hotel. Why spoil this gorgeous view of rice patties and water buffalo and palm trees by blasting ""Man In The Mirror"" 3 times in the span of an hour? (And no, that is not a joke: we counted.)

We enjoyed the walk to the beach, past lovely homes, small farms, and friendly stray dogs. (Watch for the cow patties!) The beach is spectacular. The shack on the left once you get past the entrance to the beach has comfy loungers, cold beer, and the owners are very friendly and fun to chat with. The water was calm and warm during our visit. Perfect for swimming.

But, back to the resort and its unrelenting oddness: We arranged for a car to the airport days in advance of our checkout, and reconfirmed it numerous times with numerous people (hey, we were a little paranoid after the arrival debacle!). Upon checkout, while waiting an alarmingly long time for the car to arrive, we were handed a blank piece of paper and asked to ""Write about all the things we liked about the resort - and mention names. The staff wanted us to review them while waiting for our car to the airport, and WHILE THEY WATCHED! We were dumbstruck. We would understand if they encouraged guests to put reviews here on Tripadvisor, or give us a survey to fill out later. But don't put people on the spot like that!!!! It was incredibly uncomfortable and awkward  but in some strange way, perhaps it was the most fitting end to a very peculiar 5 days.

The Alila Diwa really needs to decide if it's a wedding/banquet facility with rooms on premise, or a hotel that markets itself to independent travelers. It doesn't seem able to do both. My husband put it this way: ""This hotel is like a Stradivarius violin in the hands of a very untalented 6 year old"". Beautifully designed, but played terribly. What a missed opportunity.",0
552,"Very disappointed with my stay. On arrival, guests are served with glasses of kokum juice. As I was thirsty, I had two glasses. I am always very careful about what I eat and drink in India, but don't drink the hotel's kokum juice because I ended up with diarrhea for two days! They hotel claims to be 5 stars, which is a joke. The signs around the place are falling apart (missing letters etc) and are generally unhelpful (took us 20 mins to find the kids activity area) while in our room heavy water stains were coming through the marbling. I also had to call reception four times to get the wireless connection sorted, and when it was working it was very very slow and next to useless. The staff are generally young and inexperienced, and have trouble dealing with anything but simple requests. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else.",0
553,"I stayed here for 2 weeks and can promise why one should not stay in this hotel?

1. Staff with a lot of attitude. From front desk to bar....everyone.
2. 1.5 Km away from beach...the shuttle they claim to be provided is only available from 10 AM to 5 PM
3. They will never change the bedsheet or towels....will just fold the used ones till you notice
4. Used crockery will never be removed till alila host is informed
5. Spice Studio is always closed for private parties. The only other option Vivo is pathetic.
6. Gym doesn't have access to Steam room. The sweaty treadmill will always be sweaty.
7. Charged my Credit Card for the whole stay 100% advance even with asking me.

The only thing the hotel is good at is replying back on public platforms with false information. The guy who is replying back will never see you in person. He is probably sitting in marketing office.",0
554,"The alila diwa goa is a good and new property spread over a good space with good pools and good pool facing rooms,
The rooms are very spacious and the amenities are new with all latest gadgets and all new bathroom fittings,the bathrooms also spread over a 150sqft space

The sad part is the management and the staff who could not serve the guest with smile,the management is good professional and not upto the mark,the food is pathetic and no variety is being served,as the property is located very in isolated place that it becomes difficult to go out

If you are looking to pamper yourself with good food and enjoyment then don't opt for this property

Stayed August 2012, travelled with family",0
555,"Nice ambiance .... nice rooms with amenities but the service quality is pathetic. Not suitable for any group movement. 
Resort is away from the beach ... n they claimed to have shuttle service between hotel n the beach. During our stay I have to utilise the services of my vehicle to ferry my group members to beach as vehicles were not there and hotel refused to use there other vehicles stating they are used only for airport transfers. 
Service is below par ... if you ask something u get after 2 hrs that too with reminders. The team has no authority to take any decision and for any request you get the reply NO. 
Such a bad experience we had during our stay at the hotel ... definitely not going to visit again. 
I must say hotel is great with amenities and ambiance where they lack is the service quality. Big NO for any one looking this one for group movement.",0
556,"This was our fifth visit tot the hotel in the last three years. This time we planned may as the kids school holiday's were coming to an end. We have always loved this hotel and preferred it to the other five stars in South Goa due to it's location, ambience and the serenity it's offers which is really required when one is taking a break from the faced paced life in Mumbai. Have always given this place a lot of reccomendations but unfortunately this time we had a very disappointing experience because of the detroiating service standards in the hotel !!! am a very Selective traveler and attention to detail is important to me and due to work pressure we land up taking 2 holidays only every year!! we arrived into the hotel during lunch time , we went to Vivo the coffee shop as We we horrified with our first meal at the start of vacation which gave us th taste of being at a wedding where the caterer cooks for the masses and doesnt care about presentation or quality. And it's sad that after calling the GM of the hotel and speaking to the head of F & B 
services about my disappointment in the food quality were we promised attention to food. All I can is that besides one night of having a good meal from spice studio the other meals were below average!!! Forget expectations on local goan food , the other fare wouldn't excite your pallet at all !! I did get an opportunity to meet with the Head Chef who was pretty outright in telling me that the choice of food was to cater the large groups !! We had a fantastic experience eating out at Nostalgia and even at Martin's but all select foodie's would not recommend the food at the hotel at all!! They have a gorgeous infinity pool and also a new wing which houses another pool which we enjoyed !!! Our SPA exereince was also good!! 
To summarise all I can say is that it's a great place to stay with courteous staff but definately not a good place to eat in!!! A Beautiful Hotel which has miles to go where food quality and service standards are concerned!! We are definitely not coming back to this hotel !!",0
557,"We stayed here during the good friday long weekend and the resort was packed. Seems to have become extremely popular and talked about in the past year or do. I really don't know why?

The goods things first: The property is well laid out, not too big not to small. Its got a shuttle access to the beach which is convenient. Its close to the airport, about 20 mins. We had a really good time with the kids. The kiddy pool is nice and so is the children's center. The activities organised for the kids on Easter Sunday was fun. The staff at the childrens center was helpful. The pool looked nice and comfortable lazy benches in the pool to lie inside. 

Now for the real deal: Honestly for a 5 star property with a 5 star price its nowhere close. 
The rooms though spacious are not squeeky clean. We had a garden room the flooring tiles seemed to have some portion chipped off and the table in the room was not fully polished. The big bathtub in the bathroom (with the sliding door) seemed more like a hindrance rather than a comfort. 
The pool corners had dirt and goo accumulated. Saw that when my sister pointed it out, not a very pleasant sight. 
The worst part was the service and food. We had taken an all meals including package and maybe that was a big mistake as the food spread though large was poor in taste. Only saving grace was the dosa during breakfast which was exceptionally good. 
The service was appalling at the dining area. Seems like no one cares, everyone is running around like chickens with their heads cut off. When asked to do anything it takes forever and umpteen reminders. Really poor. Also the room service ordered for kids food takes forever to deliver and when asked to make it less spicy, it doesnt' happen that way. I cant understand how can they mess it up. 
The staff at the reception also painfully slow. Despite informing them well in advance they couldn't organise an airport drop off in time at 3 pm. It took forever to get a few cars in place. I find it hard to believe how difficult can that be. 
Our family was big with many children and we had fun, but I would not recommend this place to anyone with 5 star expectation. I have stayed at the Taj Village in Goa (see my other review) and believe me this is nowhere close. Service in a 5 star is top notch and sorry to say but Alila Diwa Goa has a long way to go. Glad that i will never be back here again.",0
558,"in this beatifull resort, the management locked the nice central pool for a wedding parry, not allowing any other of the guests to swim . it seems that a weddingparty is more important to te manager than his guests. after complaining , nothing changed , and the normal guests were not taken seriously. i have never seen something happening like this in a 5 star resort.",0
559,"I am writing with feedback about the dinner my family of eight and I had at Spice Studio, Alila Diwa last night, i.e. Wednesday, 4th January 2012.

From loud music, loud fights in the kitchen, dirty plates and snail pace service, one could describe it as a most unpleasant experience, definitely not one that would draw a customer for a second time around.

We were awed by the property itself and the elegance. However, once seated at the table, it was really something we never expected. 

Firstly, the waiters got the order all wrong. I don't know why more than one had to take the order to begin with.

The drinks came in one at a time, the last one, a humble orange juice arriving 45 minutes later midway during dinner. Cashew feni came instead of the Palm feni and when exchanged the waiter tried to light up the drink unsuccessfully with a cigarette gas lighter. Is this actually permissible? After all the effort the drink only ended up with an unpleasant smell! It took ages to even get two bottles of drinking water.

The appetisers arrived well after the drinks were had and then the dinner, one dish at a time, with the accompaniments rice/rotis coming in when the food was cold. No one thought of serving us and the heavy crockery was just placed on the table (you could really switch to something lighter for self service). And the climax was that half the order did not arrive - two dishes of mutton pepper fry, rice and a seafood salad. After some waiting we called the waiter who was absolutely clueless about the rest of the order and so were the other two who had pitched in to take the same.

We were told after consultation with the chef, that the salad would take at least 20 minutes to prepare, the mutton fry another 20 minutes and well, there were no suggestions of any quicker option. As a result 3 of us had no food to eat. We just about split what was left of the other dishes. We were even denied a naan to go along as it would take 15 minutes and then the two rotis which they condescended to bring arrived after we finished eating, all burnt around the edges. Most probably the dough was hurriedly prepared as it was raw in the centre. It seems they were in a hurry to close down the kitchen which we realised when leaving.

I would understand if something like this happened in an overcrowded restaurant and not one that had hardly five guest covers last evening. The way the staff was operating serving all five at one time, with one dish here and one there, gave the impression that these were either untrained hands or that the hotel just lacked the capacity to run a restaurant. We had to keep asking for the music volume to be lowered and another guest and I had to request that the shouting in the kitchen be moved elsewhere. It was really difficult to have a relaxed evening and conversation across the table.

I really do hope the hotel takes this feedback seriously as this is NOT an experience one takes back from a hotel of supposedly of this standard. I would not rate it as the Best Hotel in India after yesterday. I surely hope the rest of the services are better. For us it was just a waste of money and we could have got a better deal in the restaurant across the road.

The only staff member who can be recommended was the Security Guard at the entrance of the hotel, who was very helpful with my disabled mother, getting her in a wheelchair and taking her into the hotel and out of it. He really stood out for his good and polite behaviour and willingness to help. This was a small consolation for my 84 year old mother, who does not go out any more, but did so specially yesterday just for us. She didn't even get her small salad!",0
560,"The hotel is supposed to be a five star property but it does not match to any of the other places i have stayed in Goa in my earlier visits. 

The staff is not only ignorant but very callous towards the needs of the guests.( if I tell them that there is no salt in the sambar and he reverts that salt is there on the table u can understand what I am saying!)

They take too long to do the check in and one person does not know what the other is doing so there is total chaos.

There were no napkins in the rest rooms!

The gala dinner for the new year eve was at a steep price of Rs 6000 per head ( compulsory ) and what they offered us was street food of Mumbai ! i could see all the foreigners just having fruit for dinner. There was no show and at midnight there were barely a one minute firework which ended before it began.Total shoddy show. We were made to pay for the gala dinner along with our booking but on 31 afternoon we realise that we have to book our table, which was too late so we got a very corner table. they did not have to courtesy to tell us also that we have to get our table alloted or anything.",0
561,"Great place for a quiet break in Goa. If you want to stay away from North Goa tourism, this is just the place to be.

Rooms were very good. Food was very good. Service was selectively very good and at times not so good.",1
562,Stayed in alila for 2 nights with kids it was amazing atmosphere massive lung space and Waterbodies. Check Inn was not fast they took there time for the formalities but till I waited they served kokum juice and wet towels which was nice.room was nice with all Morden amenities and the bathroom was also of the same size with a sliding door which did not have lock which was disappointing with kids in the same room . swimming pool was lovely clean overlooking the paddy fields. My kids enjoyed kids club and the mini theatre. They have shuttle to the beach which is 500m from the property but the beach does not have any beach activities. Spa had complimentary suna but steam was charged which was disappointing. Breakfast at vivo was very good special there masala chai. During checkout luggage took 20 minutes to come to lobby. Had lunch in martins which was 400m from the property but could go for dinner as the stretch was dark so had dinner in fishka which is right opposite the hotel which was also good . Hotel does not provide complimentary airport transfers which is disappointing. And the taxi system in goa is very pathetic they charge 500rs if u have to go nearby I don't know when app based taxis would be launched in goa it would be boon for travellers like us.over all very good property .,1
563,"Very good property and its feel amazing when your are enjoying its infinity pool with rain pouring from sky.
Luxury on its best..!
Lovely feeling to be here and a strongly recommend to come with your family",1
564,"I was at Alila diwa recently with my family. It was a great stay overall. Rooms were comfortable and had a great decor. Breakfast at the Vivo was very nice. There is 1 thing which needs to improve ( as such the 4 star rating): The staff at the reception can be a bit more helpful. I wanted a self driving car and I was told they have taxis near the hotel and I should use those. When I asked for some contacts for self driven cars, the lady at the reception showed a cold face and said she does not have any contact. Really?? Someone beside her told me to check in google. Oh...I forgot google, thanks for reminding me. Why don't you replace the reception staff with the google search engine and ""OK google"" ??? That would be so much better. That was disappointing. Rest of our stay was great.",1
565,Lovely place with beautiful rooms. Nice food and the staff is highly courteous and excellent. Choice of cuisines is nice. Loved walking around the resort. So much greenery and it's kept very clean. Definitely recommendable,1
566,"Definitely counts among the beautiful properties in Goa. Some reasons why you should and may not choose to stay here.

Why you should stay here:
1. Beautiful property, peaceful surroundings
2. Large rooms, clean huge bathrooms
3. Hospitable, prompt, courteous and cheerful staff
4. Good food
5. The resort is around 20mins away from Margao (Madgaon) by taxi and around 45mins from the airport
6. Offers ample space for kids to play and run around. They also have dedicated play areas for kids.

Why you may not stay here:
1. This resort is not on the beach and the nearest beach(Gonsua beach) is around 1.5kms away (15min walk)
2. If you are looking for shopping and other commercial stuff, the nearest beach is Kolva beach which is around 7kms away.
3. There are similar beautiful properties offering similar facilities which have their own private beaches.

This resort should be definitely considered if you are just wanting to be in peace with nature or with kids.",1
567,"We were here (our group of 10 people) in the long Independence day weekend. The hotel is good, food is excellent and service is also very good. Liked the pool also. As its a low rise had a chance to walk around. Beach is a five minute walk away though.",1
568,"Great experience in a very well located resort. The rooms are very good and it is a good opinion for a family holidays. Despite the fact thatt the beach is 1km aways, the hotel provides a shuttle. The food is good.",1
569,"This resort is set amidst greenery and huge banyan trees which gives you a feeling of being not in one of the regular resorts. Being a part of a group of nearly sixty people our rooms were given to us as and when they were ready and the last room was given at 3 pm. The rooms are very spacious, the bath room and walk in ward robes are a delight for the guests. The room had a huge balcony and sit out. Being on the ground floor, there was a small garden like area extending from the balcony which lent natural charm just outside the room. The Edge Pool is a great pool to spend some hours swimming at the resort. The restaurant is very spacious enough to accomadate more than one group of guests, if required. 
The food served was good, but could have been better for a resort of this high rating. The quality of fish items that were on offer for buffet lunch/dinner was not good. Some items were too spicy. A few of the items were very good and the desserts spread was excellent. A mention has to be made of the flies inside the restaurant. They were on the food items, at the dining table and sometimes even on our face as we were dining. This is a matter of serious concern.
The resort staff was very helpful and courteous. The WiFi connectivity was very good at all places in the resort. There was some problem with the television connection in the room. The connection would come on and off and sometimes at the dead of night the TV would come on and spring a surprise to us.
A very good resort to enjoy a holiday and I hope that the management will attend to the suggestions I have made.",1
570,"Hotel is about 45 mins drive from the airport in Majorda. It is quite close to the beach. It has two swimming pools, gardens, well stocked bar, restaurant and banquet halls. Hotel is done up in traditional Goan style especially the lobby.",1
571,"When we arrived at the resort we were not ready for what lay behind the subtle facade.The personalized warm welcome & the serene surroundings relaxed and calmed us down immediately.The walk till the rooms is a delight. The rooms are awesome and very comfortable.The luxurious bathroom needs a special mention.
The infinity pool had the kids hooked. Food is scrumptious and lavish spread at the breakfast spoils us for the choice.The resort was full but devoid of any cacophony that usually accompanies a big crowd. Walk to the beach is just 10 min. The beach is neat clean and very thinly crowded as only the guests come there.The best part is the very courteous staff. Always smiling and eager to make the stay comfortable. All in all an amazing place to stay. I would strongly recommend.",1
572,"an excellent excellent resort spread over vast land,it is very well maintained ,the amenities ,the pool beautiful,the services good, the staff very cooperative and courteous, the food also good, the beach is close by",1
573,"We stayed at All Diwa over Christmas 2016 and had the most amazing time. The staff and hotel were fantastic. However what really made our trip to Goa was the beach shack at the bottom of the road by the hotel called Mashas. The hotel provide transport to the beach all day until 7pm and you must visit Mashas at least once while staying at Alila Diwa. Do it early in your trip and you will go there again and again. We spent most days on the quiet beach in front of Mashas. There are only two shacks there and never more than around 100 people on the beach - and nothing for around 1 kilometre in either direction. 

However, what really makes Mashas special is Masha herself and the amazing team of guys she has working for her. The food is amazing and really well priced. We were able to eat 2 meals of fresh fish cooked to order a day, beer and drinks all day and all for around 30-40. The staff are incredibly friendly and will make you feel at home from the minute you arrive. You can select the fish, lobster or giant prawns you want to eat (if you're there at the right time) from the catch they buy each day which is brought out for customers see and pick out what they want. From the sea to your plate in a few hours. Simply amazing. Masha is wonderful and an amazing host. If you want to laze on the beach and eat delicious fresh cooked food, this is the place to do it.",1
574,"Have just returned from this stunning resort where our pictures don't do it justice. 
My best friend took me for my 40th birthday which was supposed to be a week of peace and relaxation without our children and we got exactly that!!! Everything within the resort was perfect, and the team of staff were superb even down to the smallest detail. Special thanks to John and Zoheb at The Edge bar who looked after us everyday, their service was exceptional! It's a shame we don't get service like theirs in London. 
Cannot recommend the resort highly enough, we loved every minute of every day. Thank you Alila Diwa for the most memorable birthday!! Hope to see you again one day.",1
575,"We have just got back from a week in Goa, staying at this lovely hotel. From our arrival, early in the morning, we were met with a friendly, warm reception. The quiet room we had requested, was perfectly provided; quite large with a generous living area, bathroom and balcony, overlooking a nice garden. Having picked up a chest infection en route, the Reception staff quickly arranged for a doctor to visit and prescrbe antibiotics, which they arranged to be delivered by a nearby chemist.
The hotel has a gorgeous infinity pool and plenty of sunbeds and seats. There is also a free shuttle bus to the fantastic beach.
But most of all, we were delighted by the friendly, attentive and kind service by the staff. We chose the all-inclusive option, on arrival, and were very glad we did, because the food was superb, especially when choosing from the optional a la carte menu! In the restaurant, the staff were quite the best we have experienced in hotels around the world, attentive and keen to ensure you had everything you needed. Amongst the staff, we would especially commend, Alastair, Delmore, Bitu and Tukaram, who were ably guided by Andrea, the maitr d'. We would definitely recommend this hotel, and fully intend to visit it again next year.",1
576,"I was here for 3 days and overall experience was great, Rooms are great along with other amenities. Great place to relax and rejuvenate your spirits. Buffet is great however being an north Indian would have loved more of north Indian cuisine.",1
577,"My wife and I stayed at Alila Diwa for 5 days in early January. From the moment we arrived we were bowled over by the welcome from staff and the magnificent Christmas tree. We didn't expect that! 

We stayed in the Diwa resort within the hotel. The room had everything we needed, and then some. It also looked out over the private pool which is just what I wanted.

However, the main stand out was the bistro in the Diwa resort, and, in particular, the new Chef Pradip and Ricky the waiter. Pradip cooked wonderful breakfasts and snacks for us, and really made us feel welcome in India. Likewise Ricky was super attentive and seemed genuinely happy that we were visiting his homeland. Both were fantastic ambassadors for the hotel.

In case it wasn't clear, the food was great with the breakfasts a real stand out. 

There were no issues at all with our stay and we got to laugh at Russian fashion sense - which is always a bonus!",1
578,"Super is the word for the property like this , simply too good . Luxury at its best . Enjoy u r drinks in infinity pool . Bar rates are also too reasonable . So ahead & enjoy the most . Breakfast spread is awesome . Not to miss ice creams in breakfast . Kids play & activities area is also very interactive . .
Super recommend this property .",1
579,"We had a wonderfull stay at this hotell. The standard was very high and the hotell overall was quit and calm. Although the hotell was full it didn't feel crowded as other hotells usally do. The staff was very friendly and hellpfull. My wife and me was a litte worried about the food as she is alergic to nuts. But thanks to the great staff everyting went well. The food was great and much to choose from. We would like to send a special thanks to two of the waiters, Tukaram Channementri and Shaan Usman which went the extra mile in excellent servie. We really recommend this hotell!",1
580,Wonderful hotel!! Very Good location!! Great stay!! Spacious rooms and excellent food. Awesome spa!! Above all an exceptional team!!Would love to go back soon!!Thank you team Alila Diwa for making our stay in Goa memorable!!,1
581,"We have visited this hotel almost every year since it opened in 2009. That in itself should tell you that we are more than satisfied.
Of course, there have been hiccups in service, which may be down to the language barrier of more junior staff but once this is brought to the attention of the Management they are straight on it 
The staff in the restaurant for breakfast are always extremely willing and once you take the trouble to explain what is required - voila - its there
Everyone is friendly and helpful and I must mention Ramashan in the Pool area who is absolutely first rate. A real credit to them.
Already looking to book again.",1
582,Alila Diwa was really good with very friendly staff. The rooms were excellent and very spacious. Breakfast buffet was amazing with large variety of items and staff very friendly always willing to help with a smile. We will definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.,1
583,"We stayed at the Alila Diwa for two weeks in January in a standard Club room. I have difficulty walking and am on crutches so it was very much appreciated that the staff offered help wherever I went.

The room was very spacious and the bed and pillows were very comfortable (I am not easy to please when it comes to beds and pillows) but this bed was exceptionally comfortable. There are two wardrobes, a dressing table, a roll top bath, a walk-in shower and separate wc and a his and hers sink unit in the bathroom! The lighting has been thought about before installation and there are lots of options at the touch of a button. I particularly liked the night light option which provided subtle low lighting so you don't bang your toe on your way to the loo during the night! The air conditioning is great and there's even a ceiling fan! All rooms have patio doors onto a balcony which overlooks the pool. We didn't hear any noise while we were there which is just as we like it.

When I booked the Club side of the hotel, I wasn't very clear about how this worked but having stayed there I am so pleased I paid the extra to stay in the Club section. Although it meant you did have to walk to get to the main hotel area with the Vivo restaurant and the Edge Bar and infinity pool, it was so much quieter and more relaxed in the Club section which is just what we were looking for. Don't get me wrong, none of the hotel was noisy at any time while we were there but we liked the fact that there were lots of empty loungers throughout the day where we were and some days there wasn't anyone in the pool at all. Like others, I too find the people who reserve loungers all day by placing their towels on them, annoying and although this seemed to happen a lot over the main hotel pool, we didn't encounter it at all during our stay at the Club. Ilando, one of the waiters at the Diwa Club deserves an extra special mention for his big smile, helpful manner and attention to detail. He has a way of making you feel important without being too over the top. Thank you Ilando. Pradip who is one of the chefs at the Diwa Club restaurant is another member of staff worthy of mention. Pradip went out of his way to ensure we were happy with our meal and always offered to prepare something other than what was on the menu if preferred. A very small crticism of the Club restaurant is that when you stay for two weeks the menu gets a little restrictive so it was nice to have the offer of extra choice. Thank you Pradip for going the extra mile! I do hope management will pass on our gratitude. We did dine at Vivo fairly regularly also and I can honestly say, with hand on heart, it's the best food we've ever had on an all inclusive holiday. We always went for the Indian food choices and they were lovely.

The front desk at the Club side was very welcoming and a special thank you to Pervani who remembered our names and greeted us with a big smile whenever we passed by.

Having read the review which claimed the shuttle to the beach took a long time, I cannot understand it. The shuttle passed regularly when we were there and whenever someone turned up for a lift the shuttle bus took them so I wouldn't take too much notice of that complaint.

As we were All Inclusive I was a bit disappointed to find that the Spice Studio restaurant was not part of the all inclusive package. They did however reduce our bill by 50% and as the food was very nice it's not really a complaint. I would suggest to management however that the restaurant would be a lot busier if they reduced their prices a bit.

There are areas of the hotel which need a bit of upgrading but overall this is a lovely place to stay with staff who want nothing more than to make your holiday the best it can be. Thank you Alila Diwa for the memories and just keep on doing what you do .",1
584,"A spacious and contemporary hotel 20 minutes from airport. The staff were very attentive with in-house dining options. Most rooms have a balcony or terrace with luxury bed linen, towels and silks. A free shuttle service to the beach is well worth it for those who have difficulty in walking for 10 minutes or so. Good value for money.",1
585,"I have stayed in many hotels across the world and on first glimpses this is a beautiful one. Very carma. Lovely rooms. I came for an experience as you would with so called 5 star.
Breakfast is one of the most stressful experiences. Buffet I except, but no guest should have to hunt for plates, cutlery or napkins. Asking for a special order of eggs was like I had 2 heads and when it arrived it was shoved on the table. Where is the maitradee. No where to be found.
Sun beds next. Why do management allow customers to put down towels in the morning only to find that these beds are not used all day leaving customers who do want beds scratching there heads.
Bus shuttle next. My partner waited over 25 mins not once but twice to get to the beach. I who enjoy a walk came up the road twice in the time it took for my partner to get to the beach.
The staff are friendly and will do anything for you. What they lack is strong management and direction. I will not be using this hotel again",1
586,"Had a ten day stay at the Alila Diwa Hotel in Goa , in early Jan. We were in the Diwa section of the hotel giving us access to the 
Bistro Baron a daily basis and a separate pool which was for my wife and I , a little exclusive and certainly added to the holiday as we loved the quality of service from all of the staff and the food at breakfast and evening was superb .Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. From the front desk to your room service , everyone was helpful , kind and courteous. The Hotel is immaculate, beautifully manicured gardens, relaxing pools and an all round great atmosphere. It was our first experience in Goa, and any worries relating to the trip we're eased by knowing that all of your home comforts and a lot more were covered back at the hotel . We really enjoyed staying at the Alila Diwa. A top hotel all round.",1
587,"Just returned from Alila Diwa Goa today. 
Fabulous property with ever smiling staff. We had stayed in Terrace room which was really big with a nice comfy bed and a really huge bathtub. The room setting is really romantic and is best for couples. The service and staff here is one of the best i have seen in 5 star hotels. They always go an extra mile with whatever needs are required by the customer. The Infinity pool overlooking the Paddy fields during sunset is simply breathtaking. The Breakfast spread is really huge and very delicious. Our trip was made more memorable by the Head Chef Aline and Sherwan who gave us a surprise visit to our room with a yummy cake for our anniversary.",1

590,"Have now stayed here for 3 - 4 weeks for the last 6 years during January.

It is a super hotel with very courteous and friendly staff. Nothing is too much bother and everything asked is performed with pleasure.

Vivo restaurant has a very good buffet every day changing breakfast, lunch and dinner and also an  la carte menu. It is reasonably priced for a hotel of this standard.

Edge bar serves the usual range of international drinks and cocktails and is situated by the pool with comfortable seating areas both inside and out. Inside is air conditioned.

We stayed in a loft room which is fairly large with a nice balcony. the bed is amazing!",1
591,"This was our second visit to this amazing hotel. The rooms are huge, comfortable and very clean. We stayed at the Diwa Club which is just that bit special. the staff at this hotel are superb, nothing is to much trouble. A Special thanks to Jaffa, Tukarem, Joyal and Richard and all the Bistro staff. Thank you Illando for looking after us so well, we appreciated it.",1
592,"This resort gives you a WOW experience. Whole setup of the resort is wonderful. Rooms are superb. Washrooms are huge (in rooms near spa), so are the rooms. Food quality is awesome. Location of pool is breathtaking.",1
593,"An overall WOW experience at this resort.
The entire staff has a 'yes sir' attitude for any concerns and they fulfil them happily.
The food at spice court was especially good with the authentic flavours. Server Ricki was very knowledgeable and suggested the right type of food we wanted and the right quantities. He was superb at his service.
Vivo cafe too had a delightful spread for breakfast and servers Subrata and Veldone were very kind and good in helping out for whatever we needed.
Front office - check in was very smooth with Leon doing his job very well and front office manager Kasuga was exceptionally kind and helpful in helping out any of our requirements.
The swimming pool area with the the bar was a great area for recreation and for excellent evening cocktails. 
Overall a wonderful stay, not just for me but for my 4 year old son too. 
I would recommend this resort as a true 5 star property as it has a personalised feel to it which one misses at a large resorts.
I look forward to being back at Alila Diwa, Goa very soon.",1
594,"I attended a training programme here in november, Alila exudes a warm friendly atmosphere alongwith great interiors and spacious rooms, the rooms have a big bath tub where you can relax after a busy day, it also has a mini theatre where hollywood and bollywood films are played, food is great and the variety is enough, thumbs up",1

600,"Fab hotel with lovely big rooms and tranquil setting. We were bed and breakfast which was perfect fir us as lots of places to eat within walking distance. Had great breakfast, usually freshly made masala disa (crispy Indian pancake with potato filling accompanied with coriander chutney), couple of hours by pool watching kingfisher, egrets, bison and mich more before heading to beach. Shuttle to beach available at anytime. Shacks supplied beds and plenty of good food and cheap beer, sea like a warm bath with great waves. 
Tip - use jewellers next to main entrance (Zorro's) to change money. Great rates and we had rings made there which we love. We would go to Alila again.",1
601,"my suitcase was opened and all cash has been stolen from my purse and wallet. It has been two days now, no one has a clue, the security is not strong enough and security head not cooperative atall, the GM is trying to help. lets see what happens. , but this has been my most disappointing trip",0
602,"4 months after my 7 night stay I am still awaiting a refund for a triple booking on my room promised by Vipul Bhosle the Assistant Manager Front Office. Although I have emails promising the refund it still is outstanding. Because of the lack of professionalism and integrity of the management staff I would never go to this hotel again. In addition, the resort is poorly lit and my friend fell down the stairs as a result. The wait staff and housekeeping were great my issues is with the management. Additionally we got dressed and headed to the seafood restaurant only to find out it was closed.",0
603,"I was very disappointed with my stay here from the minute we walked in. We had booked the all inclusive dining package and when we checked in we found out it only included the buffet meals and we wanted to try the various restaurants. We asked if we could remove the package and we were told no. They suggested we cancel our reservation and pay the penalty fees and re book without the package. It was one of the dumbest and most annoying suggestions I have ever heard in my life. The service was about the same for the rest of the stay. Terrible and sloooooow. I have been to other park Hyatt hotels and this just didn't feel like a park Hyatt at all. The overall design of the property was not modern and minimalistic like most of their properties. The property itself was massive with a lot of swimming pools, activities, a very nice beach and great landscaping but the room was very outdated. Again it wasn't modern or high end. It just felt old. There were stray cats on the property too which were a nuisance when we were trying to enjoy our dinner outdoors.
Park Hyatt is a great brand with beautiful high end and modern properties but this was definitely not one of them. Not sure if I will trust park Hyatt again.",0
604,"My husband and I travel around the world all the time and Hyatt brand is always our number one choice when it comes to choosing a hotel. Therefore there was no question where we were going to stay on our trip to Goa. This hotel being Park Hyatt, our expectations were very high as the quality of Hyatt Regency and Grand Hyatt in other parts of the world have always been very high. 
The grounds and setting are beautiful, so is the spa and the staff at the spa. Look for Harendra in the buffet restaurant, as he seemed to be the only one with training and always with a friendly smile. 
Staff is generally poorly trained, even simple tasks like bring you ice bucket with your bottle of wine in 35 degree heat seemed impossible, asking for extra ice was basically a joke! We opted for the full board at the buffet restaurant. Even though the food was nice the first day, we soon found the choices were never changed and exactly the same for lunch and dinner every single day. If you are looking for something other then Indian food for a change, the only option is Caesar salad! The biggest issue however was the absolutely disgusting duvet and pillows we discovered in our room on the second day. We wouldn't have expected this even in a 3 star hotel! Just absolutely gross! We had to ask twice to have it changed and the reaction was very oblivious. They don't seem be using any mattress or pillow protectors either, which I would have expected in a hotel of this calibre without question. This made us question other hygiene practices throughout the resort. There was three day wedding going on with loud music and loud guests. There was also a conference taking place, which on one evening restricted access to the beachfront bar/restaurant, but no warning was given to us on this. We did complain again at checkout, but they didn't seem to know how to deal with the complaint. We received an email from the front desk manager with an apology later in the day, however it was clear this was just a standard template as someone else name was appearing the body of the text! This just confirmed how poorly the staff is trained. We would never go back and we will also think twice before going back to any Hyatt hotel! Just extremely disappointed with the whole experience especially as this was our honeymoon!",0
605,"Badly maintained room. Two main issues:

1. Roll away bed not there despite requesting it at the time of booking. When I spoke to
Them they said - sorry not available. You didn't request it. Booking was only for 2 - adults not one adult and 2 kids. All false. AMEX had to get involved and after many calls at 10pm they found a bed. No one from management apologies for the mix up.
2. Mosquitoes in bedroom!
First night the kids woke up every few hours complaining. Spoke to resort host next morning to get it taken care of. But the following night it was worse. Spoke to the resort host again she was like whatever - we tried!
Kids love the pool - we go back for that. But the indifferent attitude of management to guest complaints is baffling especially as we are repeat guests!",0
606,"Well, if you like Wi-Fi... even a little bit... don't stay here. Also, if you like to call the Front Desk and expect someone to pick up within 2-3 calls... don't stay here. Overall, we received better service and more reliable Wi-Fi from the 2- and 3-star hotels that we stayed at in Delhi. Had we not been part of a wedding, we would have left after the first night. 

I should note that the dining and catering staff was excellent and responsive. Also, the grounds and resort are quite beautiful though they are not within walking distance of anything.",0
607,"I made the mistake of booking Park Hyatt for stay in October. I wanted to change the dates of travel as I could not go on those dates. I spoke to many officials of the hotel including Revenue Manager and brought the matter to the attention of the General Manager. They were disgustingly inflexible and I was told by the Revenue Manager that ""even when there are deaths in customers families- they do not accommodate"". Is that for real? Incidentally I had booked the Taj Goa also in the same time- who were extremely accommodating and customer friendly. DO NOT BOOK PARK HYATT GOA as their approach is to just take your money and do not care for returning customers. I shall definitely bring this to the attention of anyone I know.",0
608,Please don't don't stay in park hyatt if you like luxury..there service is poor room is very unhygienic they charge high just because of there private beach. Pathetic welcome they gave us empty coconut which was already used..please please i want money back somehow.,0
609,"Had an extremely poor experience at the Hyatt. While the rooms are great and the property is really nice, the help received from the staff was extremely poor. It started while I was checking out. My car was not allowed to come in to pick me up from the hotel lobby. When I asked why so, I was told by the Front Desk and Security that it was because the car did not have the right papers. When I walked all the way out to the main gate from the lobby pulling my luggage, I realized it was because the local taxi union was creating issues with outside cabs. The hotel staff was aware of this and siding with the taxi union outside they stopped all outside cars from coming into the hotel. What was extremely unprofessional was that while I was checking in or checking out, this was not told to me and no one from the hotel was ready to either help me or even open the gates so that the car could come in. I almost missed my flight because of the careless attitude of the hotel management. Left a really bad taste in my mouth.",0
610,Millipede crwals to bed at 1am. Rude staff asks what can we do. Take one hour to change room. Wastes night. Worst hotel. Cannot be five star. NEVER STAY UNLESS YOU LOVE WORKS IN BED. Duty manager took one hour to come and were absolutely uncaring attitude. How can this happen to 5 star hotel. How if this was poisonous centipedes? Who is responsible?,0
611,we were travelling with a toddler and had booked a sea view roomthe room they allotted us for one to view the sea you needed a binoculars or telescope to view the sea. The room had a sunken bath area and an outdoor shower area both hazard to a toddler. we asked the next day for a change of room but were not so politely refused. The outdoor shower area in rains turn into a massive open drain with water just gushing down from the upper rooms as well creating noise that no one let alone a toddler can sleep through. The rooms were dirty and and no turndown services were given in the evening. we asked the housekeeping staff to place a waste bin outside the room where we could throw the soiled diapers and they asked us to throw it in the pot kept outside for umbrellas. after 2nd day i could still see all the diaper packages still there.Though fully prepaidwe checked out after two nights of not sleeping well due to the amount of noise coming through outdoor rain area. when we were checking out then everyone wanted to help and suddenly in a sold out property a suite also opened up for us. after we checked out i receive an e-mail from the hotel that they have refunded the extras we had paid. the hotel manager called our new hotel and left a message when we reverted the call he was no where to be found. it seemed to us that maybe they were stalking us to find whether we were actually staying at the said hotel or not,0
612,"Pls think about your decision when u plan your stay in Goa, don't go by the name of the hotel. It's old torn and definitely needs a complete revamp. On my arrival , I thought that I took right decision but later on everything went wrong. There cart service is not available even if you keep on requesting for it. Good items are not available from the menu... Post my dinner I waited for 30 mins to get a cart and it didn't come and on top of it there is no signage to guide to towards various blocks of the building. After this disaster walk , I discovered that AC was not working and technician had no clue. Next day when I came back from my work, I found room was dirty. No wonder excuse was dnd switch. The issues continued and when I wanted to talk to GM, every time duty manager was coming in front. Not worth staying .

613,"I have visited this hotel for 8 consecutive years and I have to say it is one of the most delicious hotels in the world,, the surroundings are wonderful, the staff are the finest on the planet and the hotel amenities and grounds are second to none. Here's the Rub, the Goan tourist board have decided to start Disney like helicopter rides in the south of Goa, and unfortunately have decided to use the grounds of the Park Hyatt hotel. The Helicopter is noisy, smelly and unwanted, the noise disturbed your peace and the smell of aircraft fuel makes you nauseous, the Goan tourist board should hold their heads in shame over ruining the most idyllic part of India that everyone should visit at least once in their life. The staff of this hotel are amongst the best in the world and it is a travesty that they have to work with such a monstrosity in their midst.",0
614,This hotel specialises in harassing guests. I've sprained my ankle and have a bandage which effectively makes it impossible to move around without help. I've had to wait for a buggy for 30 minutes each time before I would be served. Eventually someone had to walk to the reception and bring a buggy that was parked there. Apparently no one had bothered to inform the buggy it was needed where I was. This was after a minimum of 10 follow ups. It's just horrendous - I'm so disappointed. No one cares.,0
615,"Exceedingly exceeding disappointed with this hotel. Currently I am writing this review from the park Hyatt on holiday as we speak 

To begin with I made a booking in October for December in advance as we were traveling with a 5 month old infant. We requested for a room closest to the pool or lobby and a sea view room on the 1st Flr. I reconfirmed the booking 3 times as I knew it was peak season. On arrival we found out a wedding was also taking place. Clearly they were over booked and screwed up the booking. After a long flight we were made to wait and then told we were given a ground floor room despite telling them so much in advance we wanted the 1st floor. Then to make matters worse a gentleman who claimed he's the lobby manager said he was giving us a first floor room .. We were super happy only to be disappointed again that the room was literally at one end of the hotel. For those of you with children/ infants should know that's a logistical nightmare. 

Anyway we were determined to make the most of it thinking at least we can avail of the buggy service which btw was virtually extinct for us hotel guests as they were hoarded by the wedding guests. We were made to wait for a buggy service several times that never showed up and ultimately frustrated we had to make our way on foot with bags, infant, stroller etc. again a logistical nightmare. 
Clearly this hotel is terribly managed and cannot handle the load in season time. 

It's a pity really because the hotel is beautifully located has a lovely beach and pool ...but terribly managed. 

I feel cheated bcus guests like me booked in advance despite that we were given a room which could not be more terribly located, unkempt, dusty and shabby ... In the end as oppose to one leaving a holiday relaxed ... We are exhausted !!!

616,"The Hyatt is a nicely laid out beach resort, with a large pool, well kept lawns, gardens, palmtrees. The room was nice (but it took some negotiation and a three hour wait to get the type of room that we had booked: groundfloor/seaview suite). The staff is friendly and helpful. A cafe- style restaurant offers good food with Indian, Italian and continental cuisine and a fish restaurant beachside offers fresh catch of the day. Despite some initial hickup, the place seemed to have all the ingredients of a comfortable and relaxing 5-star beach vacation,

if it was not for the noise.
First week was Diwali (India's X-Mas style celebration/vacation) and the place was busy and crowded with families. That was fine with us, but we looked forward to a real quiet second week of our 12 day vacation.
But things got worse. The hotel hosted a number of business events for several companies with sales awards celebrations etc: Platforms were constructed on the lawns between hotel and beach with catering facilites and piles of loudspeakers. The partys with techno boom-boom-beat shook the area on Nov. 18th, 19th and 21st from 6pm to 11pm. The worst was still to come. On Nov. 20 a well known Indian software company held a 'NON-STOP BOOMBOOM'-event: From 10am until 16.30pm high-decibel techno sound, zero interruption for six and a half hours. The epicentre of the carnival was about 100yards from the beach, 150yards from our room - no chance to escape or avoid the noise other than leave the hotel. The following day, another huge platform was being constructed on the sand directly on the beach, all around the beach relaX chairs, for a 400 people wedding party the following 2-3 days! 

We could have digested a one-time event, one evening, maybe even two, but four days in a row was an affront. Yes, we did complain, as did several other guests. And we did receive 'heartfelt' apologies from a (poor scapegoat) assistant front desk mngr and a small box of chocolates. But the beat went on, no change in the noise/vibrations level during those 4 days. Whoever manages the hotel obviously does not care about the disturbance and irritation caused to the individual guests. There was not attempt to explain or to inform as to when/how long these disturbances would take place. 

These kind of (sales-) business events in India by definition are extremely noisy and therefore a nuisance for other guests. But the participants of these events fill hotel rooms and the thereby the pockets of Hyatt management and shareholders. For the sake of a high occupancy rate, they sacrifices one of the key qualities that a fivestar beach resort must offer its guests: a peaceful, quiet environment. This is what we were looking for at the Hyatt in Goa at the rate of $ 500 plus p/night. What we got instead, was much Disco carnival. If this is what you are looking for, this is the place to go, else................",0
617,"We are on the final week of our 3 week tour of India. We arrived in Goa on Saturday afternoon excited at the prospect of staying in the 5* Park Hyatt - particularly after reading the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. We could not have been more disappointed or let down had we been shown to the local backpackers hostel!

We checked in at 3pm on Saturday to be told that we have a twin bedded room. Now this holiday is a romantic break for me and my husband to celebrate my 50th birthday and throughout we have been booked in 5* accommodation with double or king size beds. All 5 star accommodation we have stayed at in India has been amazing, just what you would expect. The hotel check in clerk tells us that it is not their fault but our travel agent who booked a twin bedded room. To be told this is somewhat dubious as throughout the trip we have received 5 star king size beds. We tell check in clerk that this is not acceptable so he said he will sort it. 

As you can imagine we were somewhat surprised and perplexed to be shown to our room to discover the single beds had been pushed together. The check in man said there were no double beds available but as soon as one did become available he would definitely let us know. However, the issue of the single beds pale in comparison to everything else that is wrong with this room (No 254). The windows to the balcony and bathroom were filthy, there is a pervasive odour of urine particularly in the bathroom and the toilet is stained with what I can only imagine is urine. The bedroom curtain has become detached from the rail and is hanging loose. There are coffee mug stains on a welcome card. There is a used match on the balcony and the furniture out there is dirty and worn. There has been absolutely no attention to detail paid here to ensure that this room is ready to accept 5 star price paying guests. The fixtures and fittings are more akin to a 2 star hotel and not a 5 star. There are also dirty bicycles out in the corridor which again does not suggest that this is anything but a Centre Parcs by the sea. The whole atmosphere of this room has a depressing, tired and worn feel to it. We contact Trailfinders who have organised this trip and we also attempt to contact the manager but when we do contact reception, when they eventually answer they do not appear to understand what we are saying and cut us off several times! As you can appreciate, we are not happy at this point! We also contact our travel rep in India who have managed to speak to someone and have got our room upgraded. We are told that someone will be along to collect our luggage and take us to our upgraded room in 10 minutes. One hour later, still nobody has arrived (after much ringing reception and unable to speak to someone as phone again is put down when we ring). Somebody eventually knocks on the door but he is not here to take us to our new room but to provide a turndown service! Haahaha! Now that is a joke! He quickly gets the message and contacts somebody who arrives within 15 minutes.

It is now 6pm and we are shown to our new, upgraded room. This is exactly the same room as before only beside the childrens swimming pool and guess what, twin beds and this time, no attempt to push them together!!!! We are now extremely angry as we had been promised and upgrade and a double bed. I do believe the Park Hyatt are deliberately going out of their way to completely send us over the edge of insanity!

We say we are not staying in this room and to find us an alternative room with a double bed. This, magically, they do! Why they could not have given us this room when we first raised the concern regarding single beds I do not know! It did not just magically appear out of the ether! They take us to a room with a double bed. It is marginally better but this is the best they can offer. Again, it is depressing and next to a childrens swimming pool. It is now very late and nothing can be done in terms of relocating hotels but we have spoken to our travel agency and they will find an alternative hotel in the morning.

It is now 9pm and we still have not spoken with the duty manager. No apology, nothing. We are tired, hungry and thirsty as we have not been offered a drink since we arrived as we have been waiting by the phone in each room we have been allocated. 

9.30pm the manager deigns to ring us. He does not apologise but merely blames our travel agent for booking twin rooms and accepts no responsibility. He also talks over my husband as he is trying to explain what has happened. This is just downright rude. As I said, the issue of the twin room is not our only concern. It is the whole condition of the room. This is definitely not 5 star accommodation. It reminds me of a hostel in parts. No luxury. Nothing. 

The manager then offers us to have complimentary dinner which we do and to be very fair, the chef cooked us the best prawns we had ever eaten. The whole ambience of the dining area however is not 5 star. The manager also promises us a complimentary bottle of wine in the room but as you can guess, this does not materialise. On our way to dinner we pass a staff buggy which is driving at speed around a corner and the back door swings open and hits Mark square on the shoulder. They do apologise but we required an ice pack during dinner as his shoulder became very sore and swollen. 

Next morning, our agent allocates us to go to the Leela Hotel some 30 minutes away and I cannot wait to leave. I cannot leave this awful hotel quick enough. It is depressing and I am so upset that I feel as though I want to go home to the UK. The service is dire. In fact, there is no customer service. Even checking out was not a smooth process. 

On the whole, this has been the worst hospitality I have ever experienced. I have travelled extensively throughout the world and this ranks amongst the lowest points ever. I do not understand the positive ratings that I see on TripAdvisor. They do not reflect our experience here (apart from the negative reviews I have seen). Customer service is non existent. We have been lied to by staff and given empty promises. 

Stay here at your peril as it certainly is not a place to go if you want a relaxing break. We are fair people and write fair reviews on Trip Advisor. 

We are now at The Leela and it is paradise and we are having an amazing time. 

I am annoyed though that we wasted 24 hours of our precious holiday in India at The Park Hyatt, Goa.",0
618,"Do not travel to this hotel if you have an infant son or travelling with elderly people.

We were stuck outside our room for close to 20 minutes, with our 3 month old son (was howling was the entire time), while the hotels sent a key card. This is after placing 5 calls and finally going to the reception to retrieve another key.

After the key was retrieved, my 65 yr old mom was given multiple excuses as to why it was not sent, and answers varied from,we sent two boys, but they got lost, they found a lost kid and got busy in that. Moreso when asked to locate the the boys who were sent, they could not do so for 25 minutes. My mom finally had to give up and come back to the room. 

Mistakes are always made , but taking so long after stressing on the urgency on each phonecall is completely unacceptable.


The next day after the incident, no one comes to apologize - I had to go to the reception and be asked to be taken to the GM. Mr Thomas Abhrahm instead of being apologetic and trying to resolve the issue kept giving an explanation as to why this had occurred = ""We have to close to 50 key request everyday and hence they have to treat each situation as the same. On asking if this was a medical emergency would it be any different, the answer was the same""

This not the response you would except from a GM at a 5star. There was not a hint of attempt to make things right. Further keeping with standards offered by other 5 stars, we would have atleast expected someone to be there while leaving and make sure everything was going ok for the checkout. Zilch. Nada. Nothing.

I would highly not recommend anyone use this property till they sort of these issues. Left the property is quite a bad taste.",0
619,"It's not often that one comes across a beautiful property deserving 5 stars or more coupled with terrible service which keeps one guessing how many stars is the hotel aiming at!

I'm a frequent traveler with 100+ nights a year in hotels and we've been doing this property for few years but this stay is our last.

We've caught the staff lying, they failed to meet promises, consistently delivered inconsistent service, lacked professionalism, some demonstrated such an indifferent attitude, and the list is endless. In short, it was a a wash out, maybe because senior staff were on leave or inadequate resources for the busy weekend but we had several major issues right from preferences they noted to make us feel special but never bothered about, housekeeping forgetting to fumigate in spite of daily reminders to even basic expectations like lack of towels, cutlery, bathrobes, etc which they kept forgetting... shockingly even after things were escalated to the AM, FOM, EM, GM over the 4 days we stayed, service kept falling like a pack of cards until the last hour! 

There are several better properties from the reviews I've seen where we'd head to the next time. 

Hyatt will need to do something really big & special for us to even think about them again...",0
620,"I had been to this hotel from 8 august to 11 august. We made the mistake of taking an all inclusive food package. In that all our meals -breakfast, lunch and dinner were included. The property on the whole is good. It is a huge property covered with trees and greenery. It has an attached beach that is very clean. We enjoyed a lot in the beach and waves.. The rooms were good with a huge walk in closet and shower area. But my brother's room had a very bad stink in it. After repeatedly complainig to the staff they just came and re cleaned the room and i was shocked to see the amount of dirt in the room. It was lik they push the dust below the bed everytime they clean the room. Still the stink didnt go. Then they just put room freshner in the room and left. Same thing happened the next day. They could not find the source of the stink. They were not ready to change my room as well. On another occasion, my room card key got mixed up with some1 else in the swiming pool area. I had to call the reception 4 times to get a new one.. They made me wait outside my room for 45 mins. The staff who came to give the key said they were not communicated of the same by reception untill now. My friend fell in his room and cut himself.. The staff didnt know how to apply bandage nor did they have a doctor on call. Finally the worst.. The food was pathetic.. Pathetic is a small word for it.. The same food in lunch was re heated and re cooked a lil in a differen way and served in the buffet. The quality was bad and they had just 6-7 options available. I have been to many 5 star properties and they have a minimum of 15 different varieties.. Final verdict is that the 1 star that i m giving this hotel is for the beautifu property and nothing else. Otherwise its worth 0 stars",0
621,"My recent family getaway with Park Hyatt was HORRIBLE. It was so bad, that i would never ever suggest anyone for Hyatt or its brands. To list a few (1). It started with such a late check-in, was never informed about how long it was going to take - 2 hours late (2). The food was like of 3 star, nothing special - even in a romance package. (3). My nephew was in the bathroom, your staff bumps in and tell him they just want to clean it and would take 5-10 min, and he can continue his chores in rest room. (4). On complaining, you just send me a card of sorry and ready for next mistake (5). No information by the staff anywhere, not even briefed about the package (6). Room service and cleaning is pathetic, a motel would be far better than this service. (7). Air conditions are leaking in the room and you always have to inform them, isn't it supposed to be the housekeeping job?

Paying all this money for a 5 star experience, ended up in a lowest category experience, instead a business hotel like IBIS would have been far better.

I am writing this not to have a refund, but to inform you that your services are moving to be worst hotels of world.

622,"Disappointing experience at the hotel during my recent visit between Aug 6-9

I was staying in the room no 405 n had a early morning wake up call at 5:45 am that the taxi has come. I had not booked any taxi and in the end the caller said it was for Room no 413.
The phone kept on ringing continuously till I woke up. They made sure that our sleep including of my my 4 yr kid was disturbed.

Further at the restaurant it takes proper 40 min for them to get rotis ordered for kids.
Charles, Ashish n Siddharth were responsible for this and they did this in spite of three reminders. In the end I had to blast n then the chef himself had to get rotis for us
Also after getting in touch with Mr Vipul ( was claiming to be the duty manager) regarding these incidents he showed no remorse.
An example of worst hospitality. 
Regret to be here n wasted my lot of money for the poorest of services.
Wish I had got the booking of Taj Exotica which was full for these dates.
So guys beware n still if u want to be there don't expect great services from them. Just enjoy the beautiful property.",0

624,"orst ever reception desk. Worst ever booking desk. Never ever go for their prepaid seasonal offers. Because once you have paid you are caught. And they take advantage of the same. Reception desk lies too. We have reached today early in the morning and the booking was made couple of months in advance. They never uttered a word even when we asked for the complimentary early pickup as per our flight timing which was 7.45 AM. And never did they say a word when we called them couple of times before reaching. The lady at the reception says we were sold out last nite.. so they want us to assume they were sold out only for a single night and all the guests had the bookings just for a night. And they will be leaving only after staying for a nite. The lady Frency is really too rude to speak to. If we had intimated couple of times that we are reaching in the morning as the other flights are full still they couldn't keep 2 rooms for us. My mother is a heart patient and we had to start from Bangalore early in the morning at 3AM. The staff is entirely not bothered. I have myself seen atleast 5 people checking out and still the staff is saying that they haven't checked out they have gone for an outing. They are sheer liars. Don't fall prey to their eye catching offers. I always stay at Taj and this was the first time I tried Hyatt but it is really not worth it. They even gave a room to a foreigner just in front of us and were being too rude to us. Don't ever stay here.. you ll regret for sure. I should have really stayed in Taj I am sure now and no second thoughts and no experiments the next time.. any city any place a BIG no to Park Hyatt. The lady was so rude that she didn't even think about apologising even once!!


On top of it a guy named Vivek at the reception desk says that even though we booked it for 24th the system shows it for 25th. GUYS ISNT IT HEIGHT OF BEING RUDE AND TAKING THE CUSTOMER FOR GRANTED JUST BECAUSE WE PREPAID THE BOOKING. How is it possible that an online booking can have a flaw and that too all the confirmations reflect 24th of June. This seems like they have all been trained for being rude. It was my birthday and the worst ever because of PARK HYATT GOA.",0
625,"Awful service else the property is good, nicely located with a lot of amenities within the complex. BUT it seems that the hotel is NOT CONCERNED about ""SERVICE LEVEL"" and has hired fresh untrained staff to provide the services..

1. I ordered some plates and cutlery in room.. did get it may be after 1-2 hours..
2. Keep calling the reception, but they may or may not pick up.. same is for room service and Duty Manager.. try 2-3 times I am sure some one will respond.
3. Food was good in the restaurants, but again seems that the stewards have been hired are either fresh out of college or no clue about how to provide service General response time is 5-10 mins, seems as if they know how to ignore even after making an eye contact.
4. There is no option of ""Do Not Disturb"" at the room door, so anyone can enter for house keeping
5. The water running in the taps is very hard, you need to moisturise as soon as you wash hands. Not sure if it is good for brushing purpose or not.. and on asking no one had the answer, they just sent few water bottles.

All in all, I heard a lot about this resort before finalized on this one, however am not satisfied by the service level. I would say you need to read latest reviews if you are planning to come here, so that you can be sure weather or not the service has improved.

627,It is about 3.15 AM and I am writing this review at this unearthly hour for a particular reason .The thing is for the last two consecutive nights I am being woken up by arthropods called millipede .The property is extremely green with a huge number of trees and plants everywhere but if your room happens to be on the ground floor you had it .This worm like insect actually has been climbing up on to the bed which is supposed to offer five star luxury rest to its guests on this second consecutive night. Tonight I felt something moving on my forehead and believe me it was highly unpleasant .I also shudder to think what if it would find its way into my ear or something.What I fail to understand is that why isn't pest control taken seriously in such a reputed hotel. Although I like being close to nature and stuff but I really hate it when bugs and worms are crawling in the bed where we are supposed to have a good night's rest .Well other than that this property is great and we had a good time here .The staff is very helpful and courteous and they go that extra mile to make you comfortable .I would have written wonderful things about his hotel but this issue has been a huge turn off ,0
628,"This is by far the worst Hyatt hotel I have ever stayed in. 

We are currently in the hotel and will leave on friday; if my flights were changeable we would leave sooner. There is so much wrong I don't know where to start. We are paying almost 500 per night inc tax (85sq M Park Suite king-242). Could have taken 2 smaller rooms (40 sqM) for 120 per night each and for this kind of money i'd say i'd be OK. However, we are paying ""Hyatt prices"" for one of the better rooms and this represents extremely bad value for money. I can only believe that the good reviews have come from people who have picked up a bargain, anyone I know who pays 500 per night for their hotel knows that they usually get more and for that kind of money they deserve it.

We're here for 10 days with our children so clearly have a lot of clothes. There is very little storage space in these rooms and as I don't intend to live out of my suitcase I have fashioned a space for my clothes on the ironing board and for my children underneath the television. It's nuts.

Slippers: too small even for me. I'm a British size 5.5, American 8). My husband can't get his feet in them and he's only a size 9.
Bathroom: black mould and peeling silicon in the bath. Blinds are dusty and clearly have not been cleaned for a very long time. Windows are filthy.

WIFI: speed is just about OK but I probably have to re-log in about 20 times a day

There is a swamp / bog outside my balcony and generally lots of still pools of water which is great for mosquito breeding.

The hotel allows guests to throw parties in their rooms not just in designated spots and I had to call security long past midnight to ask them to stop the noise two nights ago.

Public toilets in the facility are permanently filthy-they are disgusting. I have now 3 times told staff at the pool bar and near Palms restaurant that toilets are full of excrement and the floors are swamped with water. I don't know whether the water on the floor was urine or pool water but either way it was perilously slippery and I fell and have injured my foot as a result just today. I am clearly very upset and my foot is very bruised. I hope my toes are not broken.

The spa is NOT what seasoned Hyatt customers have come to expect. My last stay was in HuaHin and the Barai spa (amazing). There is ONE -yes that's right only ONE bench in the ladies changing rooms. So you kind of have to hover to get dressed. Not relaxing or private at all.

In every Hyatt I've ever stayed in there have been club lounges and some kind of freebees when you take nicer rooms. NOT HERE. No club lounge, no little quiet breakfast area just the main square where all the restaurants are. Basically you end up in the same location breakfast, lunch and dinner and this hotel is soooooo far from anywhere else that you're a bit trapped. A very kind lady working in reception today suggested that if I wanted something different there was a nice Greek restaurant, 45KM away.

Aside from all of that I am most upset that I don't feel my possessions are safe here. I have never had swimming goggles of toys go walk about in this kind of hotel before but we have lost sunglasses, 3 pairs of goggles, 8 Zoggs diving sticks and flit-flops. All next to or on our sun lounger. So beware because nothing ended up in the lost and found box.

Most of the staff are polite and kind and I couldn't say a bad word about them, a lovely lady called Sweater even called her mum to find out Church times for my family on Easter Sunday. They are clearly trying hard. This is not their fault and I believe this is a training issue. They simply don't appear to understand the quality or service expected in such a hotel which is a shame really. 

All in all a very disappointing holiday. We're on to the Mumbai hyatt next, Let's hope it's better. Can't be worse!",0
629,"We stayed for 3 nights as part of a large group. The issues first

1. The wifi coverage was pathetic. My iPad and mobile were constantly asking me to login as the network quality was very bad. I just had to live through it.

2. Nobody comes to clean the rooms! We had to call housekeeping everyday to send someone to clean rooms and pickup garbage. Despite that it used to take 30-45 minutes to come. And we all were stuck waiting for them to come

3. Basic items like coffee and milk satchets were not replenished. It was incredible that such basic stuff was not there. Asking for water was a bigger pain.

4. The food was of poor quality. We were a large group and had a separate buffet laid for it. The food was extremely oily and unhealthy. Indian preparations are oily but not so much that a portion of it soils the entire plate with oil. The roti's/ nan's were so hard that adults could not chew, leave along the children. The menu was stale and repeated. 

5. The rooms are by and large fine. The toilet (non bathing) area is so small that it feels like a cage. Very poor design planning and ordinary sanitryware.

6. I got hurt and request a bandage and volini gel. I was charged for it. While the money was small, the thought that a property of this repute will charge for such small things says a thing or two of why they are struggling.

While the staff tried there best to help and were courteous, they seemed massively understaffed.

Overall, I am not returning to this property. Probably deserves to price this property at less than half of where they price it today. Do not deserve a dime more. 

Btw, the group made these complaints to the duty manager through the stay. At a minimum the general manager should have taken effort to personally here out and try and sort out the issues of a large group.",0
630,"Being a Hyatt Diamond member, we were anticipating warm welcome. However, we entered at 4pm on 23Feb with a negative note that our junior suite was not ready and we will need to wait in the hot lobby. We insisted that we not check in and find a different place around. Mr. Vipul Bhosle was adamant and threatened that we will lose our points for cancellation. We were OK with losing the points. He adamantly wanted us to give him a chance for a good service. We decided to give him a chance, freshened up in a stand by room and we stepped out of the hotel to allow them time to check us in. We returned after few hours to find our luggage in the room. However complimentary amenities provided were not moved to the room. My wife inquired with room service to know that we will be charged for the amenities. We regretted that we had picked this place for our stay and did not just walk out. Next morning we got about 3 calls inquiring about our check out time. International Newspaper selected was not provided. The property was not clean. Rooms had never been white washed. Floor polishing was being done near room 438 not allowing us peaceful stay. 

Room was incorrectly charged for juice consumption from mini bar. 

When we mentioned these challenges at front desk at checkout to Sumit, all that we were asked to do was pay INR 7450 and check out.

This is a cheap grade Hyatt hotel that we have ever stayed in. We feel cheated of points + cash paid for this property and receiving no/minimal customer service.",0
631,"To begin: My wife, son, and I have stayed at the Park Hyatt in Abu Dhabi twice during the same time of year. That resort is perfect in every way. It lives up to the Park Hyatt brand. We have also stayed at the Park Hyatt in Paris and that was spectacular. Both were lux+. I read the reviews before we booked, and expected some ""bumps"" for this resort. There were a few more bumps then I hoped for. On the other hand, I understand that this resort is in India and not France or UAE. In saying this, I am not suggesting a ""colonial"" or privileged bias, I am only trying to contextualize my understanding more broadly. With that said, the area itself is ideal for families (the beach is clean, wide, un-crowded, etc.). The pool is huge and wonderful. The service and state of the resort, on the other hand, need some attending. More details follow:

First, while most of the people working at the resort were pleasant and helpful and the pool and beach was spectacular, we often received very spotty, slow, and sometimes no response to requests when made over the phone or at the restaurant, or front desk, and parts of the resort were un-clean and un-attended. For example, numerous times, we requested services from housekeeping and room service, and I had to call multiple times get a response. There was the poor servicing of our room, as many times we did not have enough shampoo, or bath gel, and once there was not enough toilet paper. In addition, throughout the resort, the bathrooms were often un-clean and understocked. Both in our own room and in the bathrooms by the pool and around the resort, there was often no toilet paper or no towels to dry our hands, One time, my wife found there was not only no toilet paper in the women's bathroom, but someone had defecated in one of the sinks. When she went to tell someone they tried to give her toilet paper. Instead, she wanted to make sure a manager knew. Instead of simply handing my wife a role of toilet paper, perhaps someone should have immediately asked to address the problem themselves. Unclean bathrooms, with no paper or hand towels, and having to call housekeeping to get more toilet paper for our own room is certainly not something one would expect at a luxury resort. 

Second, a more serious problem was with the ""mandatory"" Christmas dinner. I booked the hotel myself, through Hyatt, and never was told, not once, that there would be a ""mandatory"" charge for a dinner that we never planned to attend. My wife if vegan for health reasons and I do not eat meat. We saw on the hotel website there was a dinner where we could purchase tickets, but of course never planned on it. There was a similar dinner at the Park Hyatt in Abu Dhabi but we did not purchase the tickets. When we arrived at the resort we were not informed about the dinner at at all. When I asked two days prior to the dinner if restaurants would be open, I was told they would all be open. The day before Christmas eve, I asked again, just to be sure (as we would receive many different answers about different things). I was told the dinner was ""mandatory"" and it was already charged to us. I immediately asked to speak to a manager. I did. Her name was Deepali. She was surprised I did not know the dinner was ""mandatory"" and apologized. She promised to remove the charges from our hotel bill. When I checked out of the hotel, I was surprised to see that the charges were still there. It took 30 minutes for me to check-out and have many people intervene to try to figure out what was happening. I feel that this is inexcusable for a 5 star resort. It is not what I expect from a Park Hyatt. The fact that you would even think to charge me for something I never planned on taking part in, without ever informing me is bad enough. But, even after I spent time supposedly working this out with one of your managers, it still appeared on my bill at check-out. 

Third, an additional problem happened on the last night we were there. The electricity went out at least three times. While the generator seemed to kick-in within a minute, it happened again, and again. I understand that the resort itself cannot control these things, but it was certainly disruptive (the sound of the generator was very loud). 

In general, while most people were nice and attending to our needs at the moment (especially by the pool and at the beach), the resort itself was in rather poor shape for a 5 star hotel. There was always construction, things were un-clean and falling apart, and often service was slow when requesting something. I feel that we did not stay a a luxury resort, and having stayed at other Park Hyatt hotels around the world, we were disappointed.",0
632,"Hyatt Gold Passport member. Prepaid $3,000 for 3 nights. Was asked to pay again on checkin and was put through painful 1 hour checkin. I stood for 25 minutes, at 10:30pm trying to get some kids attention to check me in. They seemed surprised that an American, with suitcases, brought by the Hyatt hotel bus from the airport would be wanting to check into the hotel. US Website said wifi and breakfast was included in price. Was asked for a ""screenshot"" of login site and charged $15 for breakfast when I didn't have it (I know- petty).
Hotel staff are kids and the ""manager"" is a kid masquerading as a manager. I couldn't find any experienced person to talk to. I have stayed at Hyatt around the world for 30 years. This was my poorest experience. Professional business travelers used to the normal Hyatt experience should avoid this place. It is very frustrating. They don't have a section for Gold Passport members and kids working here act as if they are doing a favor by talking to you. Just came from Grand Hyatt, Hong Kong, and the difference in service is brutal.",0
633,"Well where do I start!
This place looks amazing!! Unfortunately that's where the magic ends.

We booked this hotel for a bit of sanctuary after a rapid tour tour of India. 2 weeks travelling and then a week of rest and relaxation.
When we arrived our breath was taken away by the reception area and the sea view across the pools. Its beautiful. The gardens are immaculate and well looked after by caring staff. The room - architecturally - was very nice and well appointed overlooking a large pond with pink lillies.

So why the poor rating you ask?
Well on the evening we arrived - tired and ready for a quiet drink at the pool bar - we were greeted with the thump thump of a huge sub-woofer preparing itself for a wedding. This musical set up was 100m away near the beach but it might as well have been in the bar as it was so loud.
The wedding party didnt stop there - although the music halted late evening the party didnt and the revellers were staying at the hotel and provided hourly wake up calls for the poor residents - as they returned to their own rooms they were in ""High spirits"" shouting their way to bed.
Now I'm no party pooper and i like a good party myself and this was a friday night - so no issue. This however went on every night except 1 - thursday night during our week's stay.
At the weekend there was at least 3 parties, When i made a very small complaint on sunday about this - I didnt want to make too much fuss - it was the weekend after all and people were celebrating - but I wanted to find out what the rest of the week would be like. I was told that there would be another party only on monday afternoon.
Nope...not true...it happended every night until thursday (our last night!). sometimes the music was blasting twice a day (2 weddings a day!) during the day time and revellers shouting and screaming at 1 oclock, 2 oclock, 3 oclock, etc. Tuesday morning we had the honour of being woken at 6am by our neighbours having an agrgument (after first being woken by maintenance at 2am about an aircon complaint - by someone who didnt know which room they were in!).
So - is any of this the fault of the hotel staff? Well yes and no. The cant control the behaviour of guests. But they can tell you that this will happen before you book at +200 per night. They can also ensure that guests for weddings who stay 1 night are in a different part of the hotel to poor suffering residents who are staying all week.
They could also ensure that revellers keep a little bit more quiet near the rooms as they have staff deployed all night by the rooms.

OK - so no peace and quiet in a supposed sanctuary. Not what we wanted!!

What about the rest of the deal? Food:
Breakfast was a poor experience. It was like a bun fight. When the wedding guests were there - there was simply too many people all going to the buffet at once, what a nightmare. Reminded me of Bultins when I was a kid. Again not a relaxing experience and not something you should have to put up with in a 5 star hotel. Compare with the other hotels we stayed at during our journey this was terrible.
Here's a plus: The food itself was good, a good choice, and lots of it. Plus the staff were very nice and helpful, sometimes you could ask to have eggs brought to the table - but it took too long - more than 15 minutes in some cases. A cup of coffee brought immediately to your table was cold by the time you got back from the buffet.

In the evenings it was pretty desserted in the food court. There was a good choice of different foods, and the times we did eat there the food was good quality. A word of warning though, the menu prices are only 2/3 of what you will pay. Approx 50% tax is added afterwards. And it is already expensive, 3x what you will pay outside. (there are beach huts outside the hotel if you prefer lower cost).
The staff were very good though. And Anand was the assistant manager spoke to us several times to see if he could help. He couldnt - they were over run.

The pool was fantastic - but spoilt most afternoons by the noise of the wedding parties. At one stage i went back to my room at 11am and they were setting up another wedding. The sound of the sub-woofer made the patio doors in the apartment shake so much i couldnt believe that the hotel let this happen!! What is wrong with you guys!

I tried to stay cool when I complained. I didnt want to get angry during my holiday and make it even worse.
The first time - I jokingly asked for a refund - they just told me that the last wedding was monday afternoon. not correct.
The second time I was a little more annoyed and asked them to help with the noise at night. I could cope with the celebrations in the day - live and let live! But being woken up 10 times a night I was not having. They did nothing about this at all, in fact the last night it was worse (wednesday night) luckily i found some ear plugs, but i could still hear the people shouting even through them!

As recompense I was offered a discounted meal - to which i was grateful. I was also offered some points on my Hyatt card.
But to be honest - that's not compensation for no sleep for 5 days. I will subsequently be writing to the director of the Hyatt chain.

It is a lovely place. But dont go if you want peace and quiet. Out of all the hotels that we stayed (7 in total) this was the most expensive and the worst.

but...make your own mind up... seems other people had a different experience.",0
634,"We stayed 2nights at the Park Hyatt and was very disappointed. Our upgraded sea view room was relatively small with short storage space. The carpet and upholstery were dirty and stained (Smell). Staff smiled and apologized but not very effective. They spot clean the chairs and removed the carpet, which we never saw again! It took more complaints and me showing the staff how to clean the things

The room was also noisy at night when staff were rattling trolley loads of tables back from the functions held in the grounds. The garden with a number of limp and dead plants surrounding a paving slab with a cold shower over - we weren't tempted.

The grounds and pool are very attractive but there is very little shade. We were told that the manager thought that sunshades spoiled the view from the reception area! The sun bed mattresses were not very clean and the man giving out the towels was difficult to find and we invariably sorted ourselves out.

The restaurants are pretty soulless and not particularly attractive. The few meals we had were fine but the the prices are very, very expensive compared to other local hotels. All the waiting staff were very pleasant.

Internet access was charged which will make you disappointed while many hotels providing free.Spa treatments are very expensive but there is a very well equipped free gym.

The hotel taxis were also very expensive but If you walk to the end of the street there are some reasonably priced ones.

All in all the Park Hyatt represents pretty poor value for money.",0
635,"Not recommended for family stay. Rooms are very lavish and comfortable but food is not so good and service is average.

637,"I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, from the Park Hyatt Sydney to the Pierre in New York passing by some AmanResort, 4 seasons. It is the first time I was glad to leave one of these hotels! I came to celebrate my birthday and it was a DISASTER! I never left a hotel stressed and angry well... there is a first time for everything. But well for this stay lets start with the beginning: Check-in: ID dropped in front of us no real effort to pick it up by the staff that did the mistake Reception staff seeming lost did not get the chance to finish welcome drink as i had to check immediately for luggage (arriving @ 2200 no other arrival so it must be very urgent) During the stay: Housekeeping: Dusting not done in the rooms Bathtub in one of the rooms not cleaned used glasses left by the staff during 3 days in the room When asked for ID of friends who joined felt like a criminal. DM came with 2 security guards to my room talked very rudely addressed me with my first name! For god sake minimum is to remember the family name I am not a friend you are hosting but I am paying for a 5 star service! Ashtrays in the room never cleaned Dustbin never cleaned in 3 days stay! Night tables dirty and sticky turn down service only when it suits Housekeeping Nearly all the staff seems lost except the gentlemen who gave us a hotel tour which was very nice and Professional when asking the In room dinning staff to clean the table after he clears the food i got answered that it was not his job but it was the job of the housekeeping. Only after insisting he accepted to clean a little bit! Drivers are not driving safely (and I am living in Mumbai I know how driving is in India) check out took ages (had the time to smoke a cigarette between the moment i told what i was thinking of this unacceptable service and the moment i got finally presented the bill) Only positive points: Palms restaurant is great seafood is excellent the lobster perfectly cooked, service was efficient and staff was very accommodating and nice Small gesture from the DM on check out (at least that) Overall: hotel is very nicely situated great beach nice pool but staff literally ruined my stay! Maybe the hotel should think of investing in proper training. VERY DISATISFIED WITH THIS PARK HYATT in case you wouldnt have noticed with my different comments.",0

640,"In a nutshell, Hyatt has given it's name to this property and that's about it. A Hyatt Place in it's home geography has much better rooms, much more pleasant service, and is run way more efficiently. Check in is chaotic. Transportation to the airport is beyond their capability. Wi Fi is terrible, unusable. Room quality is like a Holiday Inn Express or a Quality Inn. No one around to guide what to visit or see nearby. Transport desk is their travel expert. Stopping so it does not become an essay.",0
641,"Spent the weekend with friends . Beautiful property , great spa and clean beach and courteous staff. One of the best deep tissue massages I have had . Food ordinary but the worst let down were the beds . They still have these spring supported beds which are a nightmare to sleep on and a health hazard to the spine and hamstrings . Upon complaining (and the staff confirmed this was a common complaint) they put a wooden plank below the mattress on one of the single beds , but that really did not provide a solution. Complained to front desk also. Came back with lower back ache and stiffness. Could not sleep the two nights I was there",0
642,"After awesome 4 and 5 star hotels in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, The Park Hyatt Goa Resort and Spa is a big disappointment. It seems to claim 5 stars but even 3 stars would be 'ambitious' for international standards. Be prepared for a ""tourisme factory"" with over-expensive restaurants and bars, poorly trained staff and totally incapable management. 

I suggest you find a smaller scale genuine 5 star hotel if you insist to want to stay in Goa. But think carefully, there is hardly a difference between Benidorm, Bali and Goa. This region seems to have put a lot of effort in becoming a western trash resort. The charm, service and above all enchanting features of India have long gone.",0

644,"Day 1
Just checked into Park Hyatt this afternoon. At the airport coming in, the pleasant surprise at learning of the free airport shuttle soon disappeared when I sat in the coach and had to change two seats; out of control aircon being the culprit. Not a good start...

I must say the resort photos on Tripadvisor looked a lot more exciting than the resort itself. That's true for most photos and most resorts but somehow this gap seemed too stark; monsoon does play havoc with labor intensive operations. 

After a 45 minute wait and two failed rooms later, we finally scored a room overlooking the expansive lawns and beyond that the Arabian Sea. The views are gorgeous. Reminded me of a Langkawi trip 2 years back. Sweet...

I am trying to think of the best way to describe the room. Damp, dingy, musty, frowsty...I don't know...but my nose is keen and always picks these things up before my family does. And the walls, floors, table and even the mirrors are wet; not damp wet. The mattresses have clearly seen better days; the French Windows opening into a verandah are great but one of the Windows was jammed. 

In fact our beach resort in Hoi An in Vietnam was a LOT better than Park Hyatt Goa. And a lot cheaper too! 

I couldn't help noticing hordes of staff all around us; something we didn't see in our recent Vietnam holiday though both countries have similar levels of poverty and under developed infrastructure. 

My wife goes around to check how we can keep our 9 year old busy and active. After all, a key reason to select Park Hyatt was the child friendly reviews on TripAdvisor. She is told most of the activities like dolphin cruises, trekking, lawn football, etc. are closed during the Monsoon. There is a Camp Hyatt where he promptly sat down to watch a movie with some other kids!!! So much for our plan to burn his excess energy in Goa. 

Disappointing that there doesn't seem to be enough planned by the Resort for fun and action during the rains. Plenty can be conceptualized indoors and outdoors. 

So far Hoi An beats Goa hands down. I so desperately want to change the title of my review. Hoi An has an old town that is out of the world. Goa has an Old Goa town as well. Let's find out tomorrow.",0

While the property is good looking the services are so poor i have pledged to never come here again! The keys NEVER work...

647,"I visited Goa from July 5-July 8 and stayed at the Park Hyatt with family. We had booked 3 rooms. I really struggled with the rating. There were some pros; polite staff, a great view, a good breakfast and dinner buffet. Eventually though, the cons outweighed the pros. 

We booked this hotel because it has direct beach access. On reaching the beach we were told we could not go in to the sea, because it was high tide. We asked for safe timings to enter the waters. We were told by the lifeguards, that during rainy season we could not enter the water PERIOD. I wish they would've been upfront about that on the website (post a disclaimer that during rainy season, the beach is closed). 

Indoor areas can get hot and muggy. We went to the recreation area, only to leave within a few minutes. The room was hot and uncomfortable. 

There was a constant urine stink in the room. I had to call and ask for room freshner. There drainage system is terrible. The bath tub would not drain on our very first day. The bathroom fixtures are all dated. The person who checked us in, told us that the hotel is 15 years old. It shows its age in the fixtures. Maintenance is not up to 5 star standards. 

We found bugs in our room; cockroaches and millipeds. The pest control guy told us the cockroaches are garden bugs and come in if you open the patio screendoors. So there's a wonderful patio, but you can't use it.

On our last night, I woke up to the sound of dripping water. I thought my kids left the bathroom water running. Turns out their was a leak in the AC and the water was dripping through the ceiling (and through a light fixture). The manager I spoke with about the issue (Yaarik) was frustrating at first. He offered to recompense us with half the room tariff for one night. I talked to him again during checkout and he was way more polite. They eventually waived 100% of the tariff for that night. 

On the upside, they have a wonderful pool. Also the staff is very polite (Argha in the breakfast section provided great service). The shopping is awesome. They have a wonderful taxi service if you want to venture out.

Overall, they really need to make an effort to raise the hotel to 5 star standards.",0
648,"I have written this really long review as this was one of my favourite properties in Goa and its very sad to see it losing its place on the list....

This was a repeat stay after a superb stay last time. We had requested for early check in but reached later than regular check in time and yet were kept waiting as they didn't have any ground floor rooms available...we had requested specifically for this as I have a knee issue. They insisted that nothing was available but when we didn't give up they magically found not one but a few rooms which were not yet ready. Again they were not able to tell us when it would be ready and needed 30 minutes to just let us know that!! We surely didn't pay big bucks to sit in their lobby!!
We went out to get a bike and they confirmed our phone number to call if the room was ready before we returned...guess what....they didn't call...reason - we went out!!

Since we liked our last stay so much my husband made it a point to book here for my birthday...they apparently don't decorate the room so he had requested cake and flowers to be delivered at midnight (he is allowed to give me flowers only once a year as I don't like them being plucked)...he did recofirm this at the time of check in. Cake arrives 15 minutes past midnight with the guy wishing my husband a very happy birthday...no sight of flowers! They didn't bother to write what my husband has asked them to on the cake! My husband is a gold member with Hyatt and we have stayed with Hyatt around the world and this is the treatment on a special ocassion!

Housekeeping forgot basic things like shower caps, room slippers, dental kit. Also they forgot to clear used glasses, burnt matchstick from the candle on the cake was lying around for 2 days...chair and lounger were badly stained and pillowcovers were torn!
We ordered breakfast one day and we get a call back saying they didn't have cinnamon powder to sprinkle on the french toast...pancakes and french toast are the basic breakfast items and a hotel like this couldn't serve it! Room service came without a serving table, put the tiffins on the table and left without any offer to serve...and we had egg benedict to scoop from the dabbas...both egg benedict and pancakes were barely warm. 

Multiple feedback were no use and finally I requested to meet with the GM as we do not expect this low service from a brand we are really loyal too. The duty manager informed that the GM was travelling and would be available only on our last day there...She came upto our room and apologised profusely but inspite of this all we did see was deteriorating standard of the hotel. She tried to offer us a free meal and when we refused, transport for our dinner outside but we had our own transport. We only asked them to deliver what we had paid for! 
We asked for a room change after 2 nights and they offered us something near the central area and a pool view both very noisy forgetting our basic request for a quiet room. Attention to detail has surely gone out of the window.

Funnily on our third or fourth day, the housekeeping had placed a bouquet in the room with an apology card...they don't do what is requested and then do what is not needed. The duty manager also offered my husband to arrange some surprise 2 days after my birthday which needless to say was turned down as it was too late.

On our last night we returned to find the bulb of the floor lamp fused...we were so tired of complaining we let it go inspite of it being really dim in an already dimly lit room.

They allowed us late check out and arranged airport drop. Again with an apology card and a request to give them a chance to redeem themselves...they could have done better while we were still there. Also the request to meet the GM was not fulfilled.

We started on a bad note last year at the Grand Hyatt Goa but they finished in Grand style making it a stay to remember for life but Park Hyatt just parked themselves with a ton of apologies...It'll take a lot to spend big bucks to check if they have pulled up their socks or not when there are hotels like Taj, Lalit and even Zuri which will make special occasions a lifetime memory.",0
649,"It's run by a bunch of hard working but very very junior team. Team leader is missing & what's more important is that the Hyatt service is by far far not seen.
Severe Maintenance issues throughout the property from the Air Conditioning absent in my room throughout my stay w/O any remedy or compensation to various glitches across. The fall backs didn't simply end. 
My booking rates didn't match with the ones the hotel had in record inspite of booking directly with the head of Sales of Hyatt - INDIA.
Mini bar charges were put to my a/c inspite of the drink still lying the minibar.
Mini Theatre movie list kept changing as no one actually had the knowledge of which movie would be on nor was there a notice board to read the same.
Games room was a dis/grace area which simply spoke as to how they expect a guest to be treated with power saving on by reducing illumination & AC kept out of order. Till v brought to the notice of the duty manager & AC was started which means all 3 ACs were deliberately put out of service however the bulbs were not replaced.
Bfast served with SOUR (in CAPITAL) yoghurt/curd & lassi for 3 consecutive days till after severe comments the chef obliged with fresh curd & lassi to the entire guests present. 
The hotel looked decently occupied but looked as though we have come into one of the most lean periods hence it is staffed with a entire team of poorly trained staff.
Giving it 2 stars due to the hard working staff but NEGATIVE RATING is due to the absence of a leader to help out all in place.
This is my second visit to the property but thoroughly disappointed especially becoz I patronage Hyatt with a loyalty membership for over 16 years.",0

651,"Stayed at the Park Hyatt thrice in the last 5 months with my husband.. we have been travelling to Goa on business a lot lately... 
The first time our stay was fantastic.. The property is absolutely stunning.. And the beach is wonderful too.. 

We did have some trouble at check in on our first visit in January but we were upgraded to the suite and so it was all forgotten.. 

The next time we visited in April... The hotel was sold out to a convention.. The hotel was overrun by loud and obnoxious guests.. The service was slow and no one picked up the phones... Most of the items on the menu were not available.. We decide then that we wouldn't stay here again but we booked it again this time around purely due to the location.. 

This time we checked in to find that the hotel was sold out to yet another group.. We were not given a room to check into till 4 pm despite confirmation of an early check in by 12 pm give the by the hotel... Then we were given a noisy room with almost no privacy.. When asked to change the room the staff were not very accommodating as they were sold out again.. 

In conclusion I would say that this hotel is more interested in making a quick buck off its conventions and groups, than take care of its repeat guests.. 
The romantic image of this hotel showing on the website is not the true vibe of this hotel.. Not ideal for couples and moreover they don't care..",0

When informed, no one bothered to check what went wrong. Taxi issues again when we went out at night - funny rules not explained at all. Be careful with transits, bunch of fools especially a guy called Siddhesh, and a bearded guy at taxi desk screwing up otherwise is a great property and experience. Second visit here, not sure if ever again, checking out on Sunday @room no 145.",0
653,"It's been day 1 and it's clear that the place is amazing. The staff are great in terms of their motivation and willingness to do things but they are extremely lacking training:
- asked if we can get breakfast by the pool. Assured it would not take time to get toast and scrambled eggs. Took over 1 HR and still forgot things despite repeated reminders.
- lunch time was similar experience. They got 7 people working but everyone going like a head less chicken. Kitchen staff let down the staff facing customers.
- dinner was the best where the person serving us was great but was let down by the guys at the kitchen and bar! 30 min to wait for a bottle of wine. 20 min for some butter (despite repeated requests). 
- the day ended well with the room key not working and having to trek not once but 3 times before the person helping me figured out that she got the room number wrong! And after a whole day the trek isn't short. A simple phone at suitable locations to contact front desk would be useful. 
Well wanted to speak to the resort manager....
Guess what? Resort manager was out of town and the assistant manager had to be hunted down as he was busy at the banquet! 
It took 4 people to figure out where this person was..
In the end what do we get told? Sorry.. Great that's the first step and the least anyone can do but the assistant manager was useless as he didn't as much do anything but nod his head. Nothing more! so not even sure if he got the gist of what was happening! Look out for Alex. Class act!

Now supposed to get a call from the manager... Let's see if that happens.. Watch the space..

The property is great, beach is excellent. People are good people who want to do their best but don't know how.. 
Guess what Mr. manager.. This is a high end hotel so they should have no excuses for this. And you definitely can do better than say sorry. Help your staff!!",0
654,"I have been staying at Park Hyatt everytime I visit Goa, for the last 3 years. Our first few visits were wonderful and without any complaints...However, this visit was by far the worst in terms of our experience. Check-in preferences were not taken into account, rude behavior by check-in lady, had to wait for a long time before room was allotted, room allotted did not meet our specs, several complaints later, our room got changed, but the luggage was not moved. Our Kids came back from the pool and they had to wait for another 45 minutes in wet clothes before our luggage was moved to the new room. Horrible customer service! You will get better value for money from similarly priced resorts.",0
655,A lovely location and wonderful access to the beach is completely let down by sub-par service and clueless servers. Food quality is average. Night turn down service is unheard of. I would definitely look at an alternative five star property which is more child friendly.,0
656,"The hotel is very good, great rooms, excellent staff, good food. Our stay would have been ideal, if it was not for stray dogs in the premises, very disturbing , the staff was also slow in taking ng any action in about it .",0
657,"If you want to stay in a very big lavish hotel with a great view , too many restaurant , but very poor customer service right through your stay it's your ur choice ... I understand that we are staying at the busiest time , but hotels that do well are the one which deliver best in class service consistently irrespective of the season... We were celebrating our anniversary and mind u we eat at the coffee shop ,were at the pool / visited the lobby not once did the staff bother to even greet us ... A emotionless hotel thats what I would call it ... I stayed at planet Hollywood just next door for 4 nights I regret not extending my stay there and checking into this hotel and pay 4 times more 

Sorry guys u missed the opportunity ...On the positives rooms are very nice / children's play area is good ... 
",0
658,"Apart from the pool and the nature landscape, the rooms, food and customer service was average. Paying over $800 a night I expect exceptional service and better guest rooms. Instead what we received was lackluster customer service except from a couple of front desk managers and average rooms/ food.
The natural beauty of Goa made up for our lackluster experience at the Park Hyatt. 
Personally, I felt most of the staff members were not happy there, so in part it is shown through their customer service.",0
659,"We recently visited the Park Hyatt over the 2nd October long weekend! We have been visiting this resort many times over the years! We have small kids 6 & 8 yrs so we usually don't venture out much from the resort..so we like to be in a nice resort which is kid friendly!

The positives of the resort is that the CampHyatt is excellent for the kids..the staff is very patient & loving to the kids! They keep the kids well occupied
With lots of arts & craft activities & games!
The pool is also very nice..esp the slide in the pool is a big hit for the kids!! They have a private beach which is also very clean & nice!

As I mentioned before because of the above we have been going back to this resort regularly over the years! But this time we were very dissapointed with our room..!!we had booked a pool facing room..day one all was ok but 2nd day onwards there was a terrible stench coming from our room..it was unbearable!! We complained to the house keeping who came n sprayed some room freshner but that was just temporary respite ..we had to constantly follow up with them to have the ac ducts chcked...finally we called for the duty manager & requested that they either do something about the smell or change our room..! He said that there were no rooms available in our category n we would need to downgrade our room..anyways the jist of it was that the staff was not at all helpful n there only solution was either we stay in a smelly room or downgrade!!!
The only person who was helpful was Mr Arjun who was the duty manger on the 3rd..but unfortunately it was too little too late since we were leaving on the 4th & we'd wasted 2 days of our holiday trying to sort out this mess!! We were very dissapointed since this has been one of our favourite resorts in Goa!",0
660,"Horrible check in at midnight,looking around my cottage in dark midnight with nobody to help.On reaching the room somehow keys not working so called reception through my mobile,as no other communication possible.Reception politically assured a help but of no help..waisted 1 hour up to 3 Am..Reception fooling around that no rooms available but on asking a cab to get into other hotel finally got a magical room with working keys.

Stay was comfortable but no mobile network working nd reception again failed to communicate important messages sent by my home.

Mailed the issue to the management and they are working on it....Till then ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.",0
661,"This is a five star hotel in every sense of the word. The staff are charming and attentive, the facilities are top class and the setting is perfect. The rooms are a good size, and the grounds are vast. This hotel is elegant without being overbearing.",1
662,"The property is amazing. Although I visited not at the most ideal time (around August), it was mostly raining but still I had a complete blast. My room had all the essential amenities and generally everything that you want in a 5-star property. The Spa was amazing as well. Thanks for the stay. Will hopefully be back soon!",1
663,"Travelling to Goa India for the first time, my husband and I didn't know where to begin when we starting looking for accommodation. It came down to either the Marriott or Park Hyatt and I have to say thank goodness we chose Park Hyatt! Travelling from Australia, we arrived in the very early hours of the morning. As soon as we entered the gates it felt like we came to a different world. The amazing front office staff welcomed us with beautiful fresh hand towels and a welcome drink and escorted us our beautiful room. We opted for a king room and when we walked in we were greeted by a clean, spacious room, a sucken bathtub and a outdoor rain shower - WOW! We had a beautiful buffet breakfast every morning serving only fresh local produce and omelettes as per your order. We also had dinner every night during our 9 night stay trying the variety of eatery's on site. We were not disappointed! The pool is amazing and the luscious grounds are something to look at!!! The resort is 5 star, absolute luxury however the staff are what makes this place even more special. Everyone, and I mean every staff member always had a smile on their face and was willing to assist with whatever we asked. A special mention to our housekeeper Monika and to the beautiful Fiona D'Costa for making this trip one to last a lifetime. Fiona and her Team organised a beautiful surprise for me as my husband and I celebrated our 20 year anniversary...one evening after dinner we came back to a room filled with red balloons, fresh roses on our bed, a cake and a beautiful bubble bath filled with rose petals. It was something from a fairytale and we will never forget that...thank you so much Fiona and her Team. If you are searching for a resort in Goa like we did for many months, don't go past the PARK HYATT...its truly a magical experience!!!",1
664,"Fabulous Beach, great pool, many dining options. The beachside seafood restaurant, amazing dinner and perhaps the best Sunday brunch anywhere in the world. Unlimited drinks.....amazing value. Shout out to Olivo Barbosa who took amazing care of us. So many people work so hard here. We will return. Heard a rooms Renovation is coming. Hard to imagine this place any better. The housekeeping department is tops. When my friend had a fever they brought lots of dragon fruit to reduce temperatures and it worked. Only quibble is the spraying for bugs. The workers covered us with bug spray even as we frantically waved them off. Thank goodness no children with us. We told management. We trust they took heed.",1
665,"I was here with my wife to have the best taste of Christmas and new year and trust me we did get the best experience for life they have the best located property where in we can view the beach and easy accessibility to it you want posh living, you need good food, nice hospitality, romantic stay what not a complete package it was one of the best experience we ever could have",1
666,"Was put in this hotel as I was working in Goa. Found it to be efficiently run by a wonderful staff crew. Nothing was too much trouble. The weather was impeccable as was the cleanliness. 

Boasts the largest pool in India (perhaps they mean Goa) but none the less, it was refreshing. Some very rude people there clicking their fingers and not saying please and thank you, but I am old school maybe, and just don't like that sort of thing. I suppose it comes with the 5* territory. 

If you are going to Goa, you would be hard pressed to improve on this place although a little pricey",1
667,"Firstly thank you Park Hyatt for a lovely room, amazing breakfast and great location. Credit to your staff - Fiona, Alex - and all the hard working people at this hotel.

Owing to a double booking at another hotel by Trip Advisor/Tingo/Expedia we were relocated to The Park Hyatt. When we arrived at the Park Hyatt, we were informed that the booking was on a room only basis, but we explained that it was B & B. The hotel looked into this - it took over a day and then gave us bed and breakfast on a complementary basis (what we had originally paid for), The mix up was not the hotels fault and we thank them very much for their kindness. I am currently chasing up this matter with Trip Advisor/Tingo (it is very hard to get in touch with them and make a complaint).

We loved India and will definitely be returning.",1
668,"I been in this hotel for 4 nights and it was simply awesome, the lobby is stunning with and amazing view the check in was smooth very professional and helpful, the property itself is great and the swimming pool is to die for, the beach was 2min walk from my room and it was great warm waters and plenty of space, only minus was the bed that wasn't the most comfortable but other then that the room was amazing and the staff super friendly and professional",1
669,"Excellent service (one of the best we've experienced globally and we are extremely well travelled) was the standout experience in this beautifully laid out property on the beach in So Goa. Warm, gracious helpful staff made the stay a pleasure. Went out of their way to even provide a cooking lesson in the native Goan cuisine - that you to the Casa Sarita staff and particularly Chef Tanuja. The concierge service was outstanding in helping find taxis and arranging scooties. Walking distance to the best dining spots in all Goa - particularly Zeebop. Highly recommended :)",1
670,"Finalising our 5th visit to great India we stayed 4 nights at the Park Hyatt Resort in Goa. Room With balcony and view to the Arabic sea and the beautifol gardens is a good choice. Restaurants offer Goa especialities as well as daily buffet at lunch and dinner at reasonable prices considering a 5 star complex. Swimming pools are attractive and towels are provided both at the beach and pools. There is one pool for adults only so one is never disturbed by children Daily entertainment is available ( yoga lessons, cooking, live music...). A good place to relax after many days of traveling around",1
671,"We had a family holiday here for a week and had a wonderful time! The hotel was beautiful, clean and the staff were always friendly and happy to help. From Elton & Ishani at reception, to Ananda, Zaki, Mahantesh & Rajit in the restaurant...everyone made the stay amazing. The swimming pool was large and always being cleaned and the beach a step away - secluded from the noisier public beach and clean and calm.
Breakfast had more than enough options and even for dinner there were various menus you could pick from whilst sitting outside listening to live music. You could pick dishes from different menus - from Italian to Indian - therefore never short of choice. There was also an option for dinner buffets which were extremely tasty with many different options. We would definitely return to stay here for another relaxing trip to paradise!",1
672,"After visiting 7 cities in 9 days, this resort was the perfect final stop to recharge before our 14+ hour flight home. Our room was very generous in size and well appointed. Loved the walk in shower. Wished the outdoor shower had hot water as that would have made the room 10+. Ate dinner @
Palms by the beach which is a great location, food and service very good too. Liked that you can eat outdoors in the Village Square and order from more than 1 restaurant. Had some spa treatments which were very good and reasonably priced for a resort. Found all the staff very helpful and accommodating.",1
673,Excellent property but service is very low.Staff not know the Hospitality For Park Hyatt means.Staff not cares .very disappointed.Food is Good .Rooms are clean great atmosphere location is near to airport but hotel management must take strict measures for improving service,1
674,"Our welcome to Park Hyatt was pleasant and efficient, and our reception manager was very sweet. (Her name was Fiona). As we have stayed several times here, she kindly upgraded us to a Lagoon view Suite, which was both spacious and comfortable, with beautiful views. 
Although we had problems in the past with noise from 'functions' (and last year from helicopter rides!), this wasn't the case this year, except for a 'tune-up' by a DJ for an evening 'do' which disturbed us briefly by the pool at about 4pm.
We also had very helpful service from another reception manager called Vanessa, who helped us with recovering some clothes we had left in the last resort!
I love the grounds here, which are beautifully maintained - the gardens are lush with extensive lily ponds and great vistas, and the housekeeping staff keep the room beautifully clean and well-stocked with water and toiletries - well done guys!
The only reason that this review gets 4* not 5 is that I was not very impressed with the restaurant service, (or the buffet, which looked a bit dull!). Despite there being a large number of staff, and often very few customers, service seemed rather 'random', and though the female staff and manager were friendly and courteous, I was not so impressed with a couple of the young men, one who came across as a little cocky, (and who argued with me about the rice being included with my main course, when it clearly stated on the menu that it was!), and the other who was a bit sullen until the end when he was all smiles, (but again we were charged extra for plain rice when it said that it was 'inclusive' according to the menu). Whilst these are small issues, they need 'ironing out', as they 'colour' one's experience and perception of one's visit. A 5* resort requires attentive, efficient and respectful staff, who understand the menu and each item on it, and who do NOT argue with customers that something is other than it clearly is!
Despite this, we would visit again, as all other aspects of our staff were agreeable and of a high standard.",1
675,"The hotel and staff are second to none. Apart from being carried to and fro by sedan chair I can't think of a better hotel to relax and unwind. Only downside, slightly noisy neighbours but that's all. The adult only pool is a great feature, the food quality was exceptional, the housekeepers were on hand within seconds. The staff here make the hotel what it is - it's beautiful but so are the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed very happy and this reflects in the service. I never write reviews - but this time it is a pleasure. We will be returing from London in the next 12 months.",1
676,"With about 45 acres along the Arabian Sea, Park Hyatt is just a wonderful resort with lawns reaching to the beach, a seafood restaurant on the beach that is open for breakfast, lunch, afternoon snacks and drinks, and dinner. The property has other restaurants that serve Indian, Italian, local Goan food and a Village Cafe that serves Western and Indian food, a huge breakfast buffet and is open 24 hours. We found the quality of food to be very good. Service throughout the resort was excellent.

For swimmers the resort has a huge cascading complex with connected pools on several levels literally flowing from the lobby level to the ocean. The pool area as well as the rest of the resort has nice gardens including a vegetable one.

Park Hyatt Goa also offers kids camp.

Some rooms offer a very nice private outdoor shower, alas the plumbing in outdoor shower has only cold water - not enjoyable in Goa, even in January.

The hotel also makes it very easy to take sightseeing trips in the area by arranging local transportation by nice, clean private taxis - the fare can be paid in cash (local currency) to the driver or charged to the room for a small service fee (5%).",1
677,We found The Park Hyett to be a beautiful hotel set in beautiful grounds. The staff could not be more helpful and friendly throughout the hotel. This was our first visit to The Park Hyett after coming to Goa for over 20 years but we will certainly be back!,1
678,"This property is first class in all respects. The grounds, the pools, the restaurants, the rooms and the spa are all well designed. The beach is wonderful and has all the expected amenities -- lounge chairs, towels, umbrellas, food and beverages. We enjoyed the attentive service of two waiters, Shabham and Rajit and found the front desk staff very helpful with our various needs. Probably the best resort in Goa. Another plus is that it is relatively close to the airport (20minutes).",1
679,"Awesome services, no disturbance from the staff until you call for them, very good and secured environment.....very peaceful....very clean beach not much crowd...you could walk on the beach in the middle of the night rather whole night ... love to be there again",1
680,"We booked a special holiday to celebrate our 60th Birthdays! Fabulous resort, amazing staff. ..couldn't do enough for us! Lovely grounds and super food with smashing sandy beaches! Very relaxing and we'll worth a return visit! Well done to you all, especially Elton and Antalya!",1
681,"Thank you very much for an absolutely incredible stay!
Everything about this hotel is just perfect - from the amenities, to the food and especially the staff. We are already planning our next trip. The Park Hyatt Goa is a true gem.
Special thanks to Evelyn who went above and beyond for us. She checked us in seamlessly on arrival and then provided me with her whatsapp number for anything we may need while there. She responded to my requests immediately and nothing was ever too much for her. She also arranged for a beautiful anniversary surprise, in conjunction with my husband, in the room for me. On check out, after discovering I enjoy reading, she gifted me with a beautiful bookmark. Thank you, Evelyn!!
Also, a special mention to the staff at the beach and at the pool. You guys are incredible!! 
We also really enjoyed breakfast, especially the waffles and pancakes made by the ever smiling Ankush.
Thank you and we look forward to our next visit.",1
682,"Nice luxury hotel in the south

The hotel has something for everyone including a crche for toddlers! The food is good, their pools are one of the largest and the lawns and private beach is all too good

The property is big so you need a buggy to move around (especially if with senior citizens). Not a big deal though as you just need to call one a few minutes before leaving and it will appear!

Nice overall experience",1
683,"Another Hyatt beauty! Incredibly maintained property and excellent service and food ! A resort which deserves a compliment. Great view from the room and well designed room. Liked the bathroom , it's like a mini swimming pool!! Totally worth the money and time spend !",1
684,"Very nice hotel, with the best service ever. We ran into the days with election so the government have made ""dry days""without any alcohol served at the hotel. But we enjoyed the restaurant and the facilities without the wine. When we came back to sleep, the room was covered in flower leaves from the red rose at the bed and they have made an excellent bath for us with the leaves spreaded all over the foam in the water. Very nice",1
685,"Located on to the sea-side, with an almost private beach, this vast property is all one can ask for luxurious papering in Goa. Stuffed with amenities and a nice pool, a great one to hang-out in the tourist city.",1
686,"We stayed with my daughter's family who had 3 year old twins for four days.It is about half hour drive from the Airport, spread over 45 acres of land along the sea coast, and has 250 rooms with about 250 well trained staff. The staff personnel were always highly courteous and helpful. Lot of different wellness and recreational activities and games are planned everyday. There is a Toddler's section for children below 4 years, Hobby studio, Games room and beach sports during non-monsoon time. They also have Gymnasium, Yoga class, Spa, and nice swimming facility The kids enjoyed swimming and playing in the Toddler's section. The elders could heartily swim in the Arabian Sea during low tide.
There are three main restaurants serving Indian, Goan and Italian food. Everyday there would be breakfast and .Buffet available in the Village square. We could relish the different type of cuisine everyday.
General cleanliness, hygiene standards and courteous service was maintained.",1
687,"An excellant resort. Beautiful property. Serene, calm and very comforting. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. A must must visit place. You would surely fall in love with this place. Must visit",1
688,The resort property is amazing and is so very well kept. The rooms are spacious and very neatly kept. Service throughout the resort is impeccable and staff is extremely friendly & helpful. Would surely recommend staying here.,1
689,We stayed at Park hyatt for 3 days and it was so so fun nd relaxing to be there. My 2 years old loved d swimming pool and the beach toys which were given on request. Room was so big with a lagoon view. I especially liked d biggggg bathroom...kids area dts camp hyatt was so lovely wid so many toys nd teddy bears.....rooms were cleaned twice a day....check in nd chk out was so smooth nd so was d pick up frm airport.....one thing that I dnt liked ws the less options for North indian food sumtimes.....English options were more bcz of the foreigners.....but overall it ws an amazing experience.....will definitely visit again....,1
690,"Stayed here 4 days with my wife and 3 year old son. Check in was professional and was nice to be offered a cool towel and drink after traveling.
The property is very big and beautifully kept, the pools are strikingly pretty and spotlessly clearance. With excellent service and good poolside food and drink it's a lovely place to be.
Our king double room was just big enough and well appointed, my only quibble was that the bed was abit soft but we did sleep well.
Breakfast was excellent and plentiful, in fact all the food we had at the resort was superb.
There were 2 weddings on while we were there and these looked great fun and were a real splash of colour. The noise didn't ruin our sleep at all.
All in all we loved every minute here and will definitely return in future.",1
691,"Our Honeymoon , Had a Great Time Lovely Place But They Have a Lot of Weddings There 3 When we were There so expect to be Kept Awake as They are very big weddings with live stage music lovely Beach very clean surroundings and very good polite and Helpful Staff But The Waiter Service at Breakfast let's The Hotel Down it's a. Buffet Service which is no Problem but the Basic Service of Tea and Coffee lets Them Down as it takes so long to Arrive at The Table when it should be The First Thing They Bring You as you sit Down but for the first Eight Days it's was coming to the Table halfway Though your Breakfast after many Times of asking. We Complain to our Rep and it got better for about Three Days",1
692,"Deciding on this resort to choose a family outing with one young kid and one toddler was difficult but sea breach area reviews on Tripadvisor sealed this resort and the point we landed in this resort, this resort didn't disappoint a single moment barring one (details below).
Checkin process was smooth and reception area was beautifully done with front and back open and resort really conveys the feeling of village design with very comfortable and modern interiors. The cleanliness of the room is one big plus as they cleaned up the room multiple times instead of once in the day. 
The room which we choose was on first floor with large sit-out facing pool; comfortable and large bed which easily fit two adults and one kid while they provided separate portable and comfortable bed for toddler. Bathroom was quite open with nice design. 
Almost private and very clean beach and resort large lawns open up to the beach and every day walk to beach itself was refreshing.
This resort has many interconnected pools which combined is the largest resort pool I have seen but not all pools are open to all which is good thing.
This resort has many different restaurants catering to different cuisines and we almost tasted all of them in 4 days stay and none disappointed in terms of flavors or service; breakfast buffet has large variety catering to both Indian and western cuisines.
Special mention to staff who handled our kids: one verbally active one and one physically active one.
Icing on the cake was the kids area in this resort which is very well staffed and maintained and the staff was equally playful and helpful to kids while at same time maintaining distance from kids to let them enjoy.
Its not near to main city market or the public beaches and they do provide efficient and economical cab service from the resort.
Overall a complete resort where doesn't really need to step out of resort and this resort kept my family occupied for fours days.
Now the one incident which felt like hot chilly in almost sweet resort was one when my wife after finishing her breakfast asked the restaurant staff that she plan to carry some breakfast items of the kids back to the room as kids were still a sleep plus we avoided taking them for breakfast in crowded restaurant, staff refused her including senior in-charge and then she has to go all way up to senior management stating that we will pay for this breakfast plate separately. Their policy was clear and understood but at same time we all are humans and not auto-bots and can apply rules to different situations differently. Here this unpleasant experience could have been avoided by senior staff which decided to play auto-bot.
But nonetheless, management did send the proper breakfast for kids to room not just one plate and we got the surprise in the evening when chocolate cake with personalized card for kids was waiting in the room.
I hope staff in this resort realize that everyone carry their dignity over the freebies.",1
693,"Cleaning my lungs by the beach from Delhi. This is a great resort and wonderful for solo travellers and families too. The adults only pool is great for us children free adults and the service is good and attentive.
The day spa is excellent. This is my second visit to Park Hyatt - previously I stayed twice at Taj Fort Aguada which was also excellent. The Park Hyatt is easier to get from the airport to the resort and doesn't make you feel like you've lost a whole day to travelling to the airport. I'll come back here!",1
694,I do not know why some complain about this hotel this is lovely hotel breakfast had everything that we needed the evening meals was expensive compared to the beach shacks and I had to send one meal back because it was cold. The meals on the beach shacks were better and a third of the price our room was 234 with a lovely view of the gardens in a quaint spot but a bit of a walk for breakfast see photo but you can get a buggy to take you there. While I was there I had to get a doctor to my leg the hotel arranged everything for me the doctors fee was 1000 rupees and 1000 rupees for prescription brilliant and after they sent me a get well card and a lovely bunch of flowers. The pool is the best in south goa see photos the pool attendants are brilliant they will have your sunbeds ready for you with two towels on each bed and thay keep cuming round to see if you want to be in the sun or shade the grounds are beautiful with lots of walking to be dune we will definitely be going there again sumtime in the future,1
695,"My family stayed for 4 days in January and loved it.

The Rooms:

We stayed in a room with a queen size bed with an extra cot. We have 2 girls, ages 11 and 8 and this room was just fine for all of us. The beds are nice and comfy. The bathroom is clean. There is an outside shower as well as a shower inside. The inside shower is a few steps down which could be filled as a bathtub as well. 

The restaurant/buffet:

We had the breakfast buffet and it was excellent! There was wide selection of food, egg stations, dosa stations, lndian and Western foods. The service was excellent. We didn't have meals after the breakfast but it looked busy all day long. 

Pool Area:

There are are at least 4 interconnected pools. There are also slides that connect the pools. These slides are slow but still fun for children and adults as well. There is also a small pool for toddlers. There was full service at the loungers. There is a lunch and drink menu available. The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. 

The beach area. 

The beach is located at the end of the property. There was also a restaurant from the hotel on the beach available and loungers as well. The sea was warm with rolling, gentle, waves. Arossim Beach is large and quiet. 

Overall, this is an excellent hotel, we have visited India several times. This hotel is our favorite hotel by the beach. I highly recommend this hotel! ",1
696,Recently visited park hyatt for our 10 th anniversary it was a wonderful stay n the hotel made our day even more special by givin us few surprises i can easily say this is one of the best property i ve stayed in goa.,1
697,"We had been to park Hyatt as part of a wedding party with almost over 80 rooms booked. It was spread over 3 nights. Excellent property, rooms, room service, great breakfast and lunch and dinner at all the wedding functions. Toilets are great with state of the art toiletries. I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that Ms. Frency, front end staff was outright rude and very unprofessional in the way she handled customers from the wedding party. Her lack of professionalism really put us back as it was opposite of our experience during our stay. Please visit the property keeping in mind that one person can ruin your holiday! Well done Ms. Frency.",1
698,"Everything about the hotel was great, the food was great, it was clean, the room was good, the staff were friendly. The only trouble we had was that there was a wedding on which meant loud music in to the night and some of the restaurants / bars were closed on occasion.",1
699,"Never thought the Park Hyatt was really up there. But was pleasantly surprised. Performed in its banquets. 

The property is landscaped beautifully and has an absolutely relaxing feel and look to it. You can't help but slip into holiday mode when you walk about. 

Excellent fish curry rice and Goan cuisine available at the main restaurant. Highly recommend it. 

Would love to return and hopefully stay at the resort.",1
700,"Amazing service.....the Park Hyatt Goa Resort &Spa is a special hotel with exceptional service. We stayed for four nights January 2017 and I have to say it's the best resort hotel where the cleanness is outstanding. Normally in such a climate you would expect a level of insect life within the resort particularly mosquitoes, flies etc but at the Park Hyatt we found none. The rooms were serviced twice a day, the pools were very clean, every restroom within the confines was kept in pristine conditions and smelling very fresh. The staff are outstanding Elton helped us check in early as our flight arrived at 8am and sorted out our rooms in quick time. The restaurant waiting staff in particular Shubham was outstanding helping us with our every need. I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to revisiting Goa in the very near future.",1
701,"Terrible pathetic absurd shame on the staff and GM
The hotel or the staff who changes there behaviour after sales should never be given any business 
It's was 13-16sept2016 
Hospitality doesn't mean only rooms and dine
It means lot beyond it which this hotels fails completely 
Anything which is in itinerary should be provided whole heartily
We given them a business of approximately 18lacs and they didn't respect even over travel arrangements which was part of quotation
When I spoke to general manager about it he said though it was our responsibility but if we fail then ""guest take taxi n come to hotel"".
Not only this all the 3days it was some how same with travel arrangements
Further ""Maya K."" was the business executive who lied about conference arrangements and Organised our conference in a very pathetic location and Which was later arranged by myself by going hotel to hotel and checking at country inn by Carlson which should have been paid by hotel and we made payment for that.

Not even taxi payment was remembered 
Whenever I tried reaching maya(the employee) use to avoid my call or disconnect in between.
The worst behaviour I ever seen in this hospitality industry 
So without writing much let me simply conclude it was 230 guest I had in my company
Before business was given to them every one was polite and welcoming and once we checked in their behaviour was so careless and annoying I felt to check out on same point but I was bounded as it was company's trip and I already paid 17lacs to them
Being CEO and managing director 
Let me aware all the travellers this hotel doesn't deserve your stay
They being in hospitality industry and not respecting the whatever they promised in their quotation or business agreement is ridiculous.
And look at the irony they are so rigid that they doesn't even feel sorry even after poor arrangements ,instead start lecturing you regarding managing your own.
They claim that they are 4star hotel but they totally zero in treating a guest.
Finally if they would keep going with same ethics, they themselves will learn lesson with poor business turnovers.
Moral to guest only : visit this property if you want to pay for your own humiliation.",0
702,"The hotel looks good from outside, but the staffs don't know how to behave with the customers.they need more training on how to satisfy a customer in terms of service. They will never help you in arranging a car for local sight seeing , neither self driven one nor taxis. They will give you suggestions rather to go in a bus and do the local sight seeing. Simply disgusting.room service is also not up to the mark, I went there with my 2 year old baby and in order to get baby's milk I had to follow up so many times, they also sometimes forget to clean the rooms. The duty managers have so much attitude, I don't know they are showing attitude for what.... Overall my experience was poor with this resort, inspite of such high pricing they are not able to provide you service as expected,. With such price range please go for some better hotels which may include the top ones like taj, where you will get the value for money service.",0
703,very poor service i had a booking of three days but stayed only for 1 day and shifted to another hotel i stayed in room no 461 and order a bottle of water at 5 in the morning but received the same after three calls at 6 in the morning,0
704,Where do we start the girl on reception was dam right rude they didn't give a stuff about other guests only Indian ones food terrible were serving flat beer and tonic we were all inclusive but we ate out this place needs to be taken out of English brochures as they clearly only cater for Indian people,0
705,Very poor. Poor service and poor upkeep. Went for buffet on invitation from my co-brother. They were thoroughly disappointed with the service. Then we called the room service guy for bottle opener. He came but was not willing to leave behind the opener. Then came the food. Lesser said better it is. Very very poor. It's place which in a way does not want u to come back.,0
706,"Four of my friends visited last week and I think I was really carried away with the too much of hype on the reviews. This place doesn't really worth your money, really this is not worth a star hotel. Neither they maintain the standard of star hotel nor their staff are trained to behave with guests. Their food spread is pathetic, they just give some set menu quoting that they don't enough guests and still charge the buffet price. More than the money, it is about the time and effort that you spend with the staff/manager (especially their incharge called Radha is horrible and she spoils your holiday in the first meeting itself) all the time which really spoil your holiday. Their transfers are not on time. I wanted to talk to few of them who were talking big while taking the reservations/booking, no one turned up and/or called me. In total, I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The only matured person who was helping us was Prashant, one of their Manager, poor guy, he is definitely in a wrong place. There was a Big gang on the other day who really made a mess of that place / Swimming pool and some of the couple came as a family talking to us were cursing themselves for choosing this place. Strict NO for family.",0
707,"me and my 3 children booked in this hotel end of April 2014. One of the worse hotel I came across it can't be 4 star at all. In shower all water goes in to room . no toiletries . and worse it is so unsafe for women to stay here. we had to lock ourself in room, we waited for the morning so we can find another hotel and move out.breakfast was not good either.
at night 2 Russian girls needed to be escorted to their rooms by staff. all because some 150 men were staying in the hotel, and management said they didn't know they were all men . what a joke 
never ever book in this hotel if you are travelling with family. unless you like to go through trauma my daughter had to go through.",0
708,i have stayed at this hotel in April..i hired a mahindara thar from outside and hotel staff has torn its seats and scratch the car and i have to pay 6000 inr to the owner of the car.nobody in hotel was able to answer they were just blaming others.,0
709,"I stayed at this hotel, the food was terrible, evey dish looked the same.
My room was big and fairly clean.
When it came to the last day we were told our occupancy had come to an end, even though we were not due to be picked up to leave the hotel until 6 am.We were not allowed to stay in the lounge and had to book into another hotel until pick up time!!!!!!!",0
710,"I stayed here in 2012 with my boyfriend for two nights. we saw online and liked the hotel pictures but plsss!!! its nothing like that in real life!!!!! crappy tile floor, dirty bathrooms. Bad service and since this hotel caters to a lot of groups there were hooligans indian families, dont be fooled by bikini clad women in their jacuuzi (like on the website) there are men and the water is infested with insects. Only ok thing was breakfast and location was somewhat convenient to the major destinations nearby",0
711,I have been to goa 7 times and stayed in differrent hotels and resort..... But whispering palms was the worst hotel i have stayed in... We took the studio elite rooms which were supposed to be the best rooms in the hotel but the rooms were just like the standard room u get in a cheap hotel.... The food was ok..... The service was disgusting..... No care taken towards the guest... No respone from the staff for any damn thing u req for.... Overall the hotel is just not worth going to...... Also suggest others try for different hotel in this area.... U have better options around... Wld never return and also wld never suggest neone to go to the hotel,0
712,"Booked flight+ two nights through makemytrip.com. It was a disappointing trip for our family. The hotel was undergoing renovation. Most of the facilities were not available like swimming pool, spa, gym, children play area. Food was mediocre. Firstly on our arrival they were denying us food coupons even though we paid in advance to makemytrip for the same. Room was not up to the mark of a 4 star hotel which they claim it to be. Waste of money as they portray themselves to be a beach resort and having a beach property which is totally untrue. Hot water in washroom is a major issue..its only available for few hrs during morning and evening...they ruined our holiday.",0
713,"Went in August Mid - No swimming pool, they have built restaurent in the swimming pool area - Not a 5 star property (they claim to be 5 star in some sites) - The nearby beach has no activity whatsoever - All bathroom amenities not replaced daily - Room service slow",0
714,"We went to this resort in mid July for a couple of days and it was all on work!! No restaurant, no swimming pool and the reception installed on room 205!! They lied to our tour operator and say nothing about the works when he made the booking!! Only a few rooms are in use, lightly refurbished but look old in general (the doors, the bathroom...) and just a plastic swimming pool in a corner of a small garden!!! Be careful!!",0
715,"Nothing!!! Visited Whispering Palms seven years ago, our first visit to Goa. It was fantastic, we have returned to Goa every year since. Returned to Whispering Palms this year, what a disappointment! We had three rooms, two rooms above the reception, very noisy. Kitchen fans start at 5.00 in the morning, like trying to sleep on a plane. Delivery vans turning up from 6.00. Moved to a room on the right of the pool. It was dirty and gloomy. When we asked staff about the dirty rooms we was told that they where being renovated next year! So we have to live in the dirt until then? The main problem with the Hotel is RATS. Now some one wrote in 2011 about the rats, but I dismissed it. But sat around the pool one evening, I saw the biggest rat I have ever seen. It walked around a ground floor balcony, jumped onto the out door kitchen counter and drop into the kitchen. I went straight over and told the Chef, who laughed! Looking over the counter, I could see a chest freezer with trays of uncovered food on it. The rat jumped back out at me and escaped. 

A few days later we asked to keep our room on for a late departure, and told that they could not tell us until later in the week and would also charge us. I asked the Rep if anything had been done about the rat in the kitchen. The look of surprise on her face! She contacted the House manager and I was asked to explain what I had seen.

I was told straight away that I could keep the room on no charge! They also went and cleaned our room, four people for two hours, they took every thing out of our room and fully cleaned it.

I filled a complaint form in regarding the dirt and the rat. On departure from the hotel, the assistant manger, tried to get me to sign a form, saying I would take no further action.

As far as I could see nothing had been done to stop the rats getting into the kitchen. We never ate at the hotel, for the last week.

On our return I emailed Ryan Bailey from Thomas Cook, all I got was corporate spell, saying I should of reported things earlier in our holiday. The rats had been reported a year earlier!! how long do they need?

I all of the correspondance with Ryan, he never made reference to the RATS.

We will be returning to Goa next year but will not be staying at Whispering Palms.

716,"Not a nice place to stay only ate once in the hotel as food very poor and repetitive. Rooms small and cramped not enough room to put. clothes, they were also in a poor state as was the whole hotel. .Not enough room around the pool only about 30 sunbeds so spent every day on the beach. Would I stay there again no not even if I was paid to, this is not an unfair review just giving an honest picture.",0
717,"The hotel was decent enough to stay...but it doesn't go well with the pictures updated in their website...the food was really really nice...but the service was pathetic?.very small rooms, no cleanliness...shortage of towels...argumentative staff...it's no for me...though the ko aril is effect to stayin goa...",0
718,"Very disappointed with this hotel not only is it dirty but it had RATS in the restaurant. Around the tables and on your balcony there were crows/rooks swooping down and pinching food at all mealtimes. Slabs of tile around the swimming pool and hotel grounds were uneven and dangerous (one man actually falling down and splitting his leg open from knee to ankle). Management were very poor, waiters were poor and staff around the hotel was not helpful in any way very dismissive of feedback and comments. Definitely would not return to this hotel. Only positive things would be the house keeping in the bedrooms as these were immaculate and the Thomas Cook rep.",0
719,"The measure of a successful vacation is based on the feeling that one gets at the end of the trip - i.e., not wanting to return back to work / home. But in this case, we are so happy to return back home and we actually cutt short our vacation. In fact today was our return date, but we cut short our trip, as the entire experience was that of disbelief and dissappointment. Starting from a lie that the hotel is on the beach, dirty linen inside the room, smelly curtains, worn out toilets, partial treatment of staff towards Indians (very obedient to the foriegners though), horrible spa (no privacy, ill equipped, ill trained masseuse, immature behaivour) lack of spread in the buffet (I understand that this is subjective though). The best coffee we had was at the Anujan market and the best lunch we had was at Topnosh restaurant across the main road! The saving grace was two staff - Pratik and Surender, both at the restaurant, who were always smiling and helpful - I wish they get better jobs. And the best of all, on lodging complaints periodically and on check out - the senior staff were not all too apologetic. We were very happy when we finally landed back at our home in Bengaluru. Request people to suggest us any other good resort / hotel in Goa, so that we can shake off this experince, once and for all.",0
720,"We have just spent 5 days in this hotel and must say that is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed in. We were in a group of 13 people and everybody agreed on this point.

To start with, the management refused to honour an upgrade voucher to a single room for one of our group, alleging they had no instructions from the agency in India,(despite the fact that we had a paper voucher with the agency stamp on it) putting her instead in a double with two other people, in a folding bed for small children. So she ended up paying 14,500 Rupees extra to sleep on a camp bed.

The management in general was arrogant and unhelpful, including a head receptionist whose idea of customer service was barking at people and throwing her (considerable) weight around.

Paradoxically, most of the rest of the staff were very friendly including the waiters, although you could tell that most of the waiters were young and inexperienced, probably hired at a minimum wage to save money

As far as the hotel installations were concerned, they are way below what you would expect for the price you pay:

- A small, overcrowded swimming pool with the sun beds right at the edge for lack of space so you are constantly splashed by the kids playing in the pool.

- Run down, tacky rooms with rotting door frames, dirty buckets in the bathroom and threadbare towels (Im talking about the superior rooms we paid an extra 6,000 Rupees for, the normal rooms are even worse).

- No net curtains, so everyone can see into your room if its on the ground floor, meaning you can never have any natural daylight for lack of privacy.

- No hot water in the bathroom for one of the days.

- Dirty, greasy floors and surfaces in the bedroom, despite the daily cleaning service.

The services arent much better the evening entertainment seemed to be a competition to see which band could play worse and sing more out of tune. Also, they played so loud we actually put in a written complaint because it was impossible to have dinner outside, due to the volume.

We asked for a double bed repeatedly, and never got one. We had two single beds (we are a couple).

The list goes on but I think that generally gives an idea of the hotel. The most important thing was the total indifference of the management with reference to our complaints. You basically got the feeling that they didnt care. The managing director was particularly arrogant and unhelpful.

To sum up, this hotel is a rip off and neither I nor any of the other 12 in our group would dream of recommending it to anybody.",0
721,"property is descent but House Keeping was not good.I asked for fresh towel in the room and was told it will be vaialable only after 8.30 am as their laundry comes during that time.I was surprised that hotel with over 100 rooms,doesnt have 1 extra towel.Infact my husband requested for 1 towel then the person from house keeping just banged down the phone.",0
722,"We really had multiple reasons to say ""Not Recommended"" in this hotel. We had booked a deluxe room, on 3N4D +MAP basis. Before finalizing this hotel, I had gone through many reviews for most of the 3 Star hotels in Candolim. As the reviews and pictures were looking great I zeroed on this hotel. But overall experience was totally negative. 

First of all, Pickup. We informed hotel sales manager that we will be delayed by 12 hours reaching Goa since we missed our flights. and what we heard from him was that, ""arrange your taxi"" to reach hotel. We got there early morning at 6 A.M. For some reasons, they gave us Classical Room instead of Deluxe. But when we got into the room, the bed was not clean. It looked like the room was not cleaned for many days. Looking at the room, it was not even close to the way it looks in the pictures!!! I would say, good photography. Since the condition of Classical room was this, we were left imagining what would be the state of Deluxe and standard rooms??!!

Second thing, next day the hot water was ""Muddy"". after complaining what we got is only bucket of hot water from outside after around one hour. It took the whole day to get a clean hot water. 

Third thing, the electricity was fluctuating for about 15-20 mins. Fourth thing, when it rained whole room was flooded with water came from balcony coz of lack of proper drainage. Most of the time we spent in hotel, one or the other reason, there was somebody to fix something. 

House keeping staff would come at any time in the day and ring. All the hotel staff/Room service whenever they ring the bell are inpatient. After they ring the bell, they knock the door. all in a space 5-10 seconds.!!! horrible!!

In restaurant we always felt the place was crowded, not spacious enough to accomodate hotel stayers. The swimming pool area was even bad. This time I would say, its not coz of hotel but coz of people. Live entertainment was not that great too. Very average. Internet card was very costly. 

Finally, the location of hotel is really nasty. The beach is close enough, but you can't get into the water coz its unsafe and very dangerous. There is not even a medical store nearby. Whichever is there, is closed all the times. The men who roam around area are kind of scoundrels who always gets close whenever they couples. 

Overall, hotel was bad experience and with the kind of location and people around it even made it worser. Not recommended for honeymoon couple. May be better for family with kids as that was the case with most of families we saw in this hotel.",0
723,on arrival at hotel we found that hotel had over booked which meant we had to be put in a upgrade room with the promise of moving the next day but it took the hotel 4 days to move us and when they did they put us in a room which stunk and sewage was coming back through toilet again we had to move and then we had money stolen from our room of which my friends money was in a locked suitcase the thief had removed the padlock from the case and the lock was nowhere to be seen and i had hid my purse under all my clothes we understand the need to use safety deposit boxes but we always had our belongings with us and this particular day we had only left the room for approx half an hour to go and get a drink when we spoke to hotel staff about the theft they were not interested and accused us of misplacing our money we asked for local police to be informed the hotel refused claiming that local police would not be interested we also asked to see the manager of the hotel and staff told us he was ill and visiting the doctors it was not until another guest assisted us that they took us to see the manager who was sitting in his office and was not at the doctors when staff visited our room to look for money they said they would search the staff and they were laughing at us the hotel staff also searched all of our belongings to look for the money as they thought we had mis placed it. when we went to see the manager we explained that we would need a police report in order to claim for our money and he advised us to claim for 600 pound which is a lot more then we lost. at the end another guest contacted the police and they attended the hotel and we had to go along to the police station to get a crime report it was only then that the staff started to take us seriously. the hotel itself is looking very aged and the swimming pool is in desperate need of repair also the food choices were terrible with very little choice.,0
724,"I would only recommend this hotel if you like a holiday akin to the series Benidorm (Eat, drink and smoke as much as you possibly can). 

Firstly the rooms are substandard - the garden based rooms being marginally better - sheets and towels are dirty and stained. The pillows are lumpy and best not looked at. 
The pool is too small but the beach is closeby. The tanker marooned on the beach is quite impressive and the food is good in the hotel although a better choice of fruit at breakfast would be advantageous. There are not enough tables or sunbeds at the hotel and this was out of season with few guests - well initially anyway.

The hotel thought it was a good idea to have 150 school children at the hotel wiith 4-5 per room whilst we were there. We were well impressed to be woken up at 5.00am to their screams and shouting for 5 days. Management were unable to control the noise. Also there were a number of business conferences held onsite. We found that generally the Indian guests at the hotel were rude and had apalling manners. Men spat in the pool and lacked basic behavioural standards.

A point that amused us was that chairs at the bar were reserved with towels for the day - this was not something we had seen before and it concisely summed up the place.",0
725,"Limited facilities at hotel. Rooms very poor (2**) unless you are firm and insist on their newer better rooms (3**). No hot water while we were there. Meals very limited menus. Beach is polluted by the rusting shipwreck. Even the slightest breeze kicks up a frothy seaspray which covers you in smelly greasy oil even if you dont go into the filthy sea.

Stay away if you have a family.

Disliked  Location of hotel and poor quality of rooms",0
726,silly me locked all my belonings in my suitcase with combination lock instead of putting in safe at reception.240 stolen from wallet all doors locked police involved .loveley hotel but please be carefull with belongings on our first day a littlle girls psp stolen again only people in reception cleaning staff.,0
727,"On arrival at the Whispering Palms we were greeted by friendly staff and our bags were taken to our room for us. 

The room was clean but terrible and I was particularly concerned about the apparent lack of security. Our balcony overlooked the pool and this meant that the waiters had a clear view into our room. The bathroom was basic but functional, however I had real concerns about the electrical socket in the shower. We could hear people on our balcony and outside the front door at night and this was very concerning.

On our first full day we went to the beach. We suffered continual hassle from men working on the beach and the experience was generally unpleasant. There is a huge tanker rotting away in the sea - this a complete eyesore. 

The food in the restaurant was extremely average but there was plenty of choice. Again, we received far too much attention from the men working in the restaurant and it was difficult to relax.

The evening entertainment was not necessarilly entertaining in the way that had been intended but it was good fun regardless.

The pool area is extremely small and cramped and is not really designed to cope with the number of guests staying in the hotel and the spa treatment areas are truly unpleasant.

Goa is a fascinating place that I would like to return to. However, next time it will be with my husband in South Goa and I will pay for a decent hotel.

728,"We stayed in this Hotel for 3N/4D Package. Trouble started when we arrived at Goa Airport. No body came to pick us up although it was included in our package. We called the hotel they advised us to take a taxi and we are required to pay for the same. Hotel just refused to pay for taxi although it was included in the package blaming the travel agent. 

We have booked room with extra bed (paid extra) as I was traveling with 2 small kids and my wife. However room was not having enough space for extra bed and the bed was just dumped in the room. Room was far from the pool / reception and on the back side and we were told this is the only room available 

On the day of our departure although we have informed them about our flight details (after noon at 3.00 clock check out) Lady suppose to be manager called at 12.30 and asked us to vacate the room immediately as other guest has already arrived to whom they want to allocate the room. We were forced to vacate the room immediately with our kids in an insulting manner although we have paid for 4 Days well in advance.

Fortunately they dropped us at Airport, however the driver was driving car like a jet plane on small roads of Goa as he was suppose to pick up other guest and was getting late.

It was a Horrible experience for us to stay in this hotel.

729,"Saved for ages to treat our daughter & grand daughter. Went all inclusive to save them any expenditure. Absolute waste of money.

Breakfast had little English choices and curry is not appealing in the morning. Every day , no cups (always chipped when they did finally arrive), 10 minute wait, then no teabags, 10 minute wait, no milk, total disaster, walk out & go to Ganesh beach shack for tea and breakfast. Food lunch and dinner was barely warm, repetitive & always covered in flies. Food area was not clean and service slow. The snack menu had a choice but only about 2 items were ever available. The 'a la carte' menu had several itmes which were not available. Many guests complained about stomach upsets and several guests joined together and complained to the manager. 

Few sunbeds and sparse room around pool for number of guests. The pool area was full of tables for people to eat which meant no room for sun bathing and no where nice to eat with out getting splashed from the pool. Bad set up all round.

Balcony could not be used as air conditioning unit flooded balcony. Management did place bucket under leak but room maid did not empty bucket which had overflowed by the time you returned from beach.

Never any clean glasses behind the pool bar. Long wait while staff frantically tried to locate glasses and wash them. Although all inclusive, the bar one early evening had no Vodka.

Staff were pleasant but it appeared that who ever owned the hotel was happy to take the profits and not invest any money back into hotel improvements.

Thank goodness for the Ganesh shack on the beach. Good food unlike the buffet food in the hotel did not upset stomachs. Ganesh, his sister and staff were so helpful, amusing the baby, organising taxis and trips, they compensated for our awful hotel choice. They were even willing to cook the meals of your choice so you could enjoy an evening meal on the beach. If you go to the beach this is the shack to go to for good service and value.

Several guests did state that they had stayed at Whispering Palms 4/5 years ago and could not believe how rapidly it had gone from good to dire. I would not recommend ths hotel to anyone unless they lower their prices to reflect 1* plus prices.",0
730,"We stayed at this Hotel for Cristmas and new Year it was very dissapointing.The Deluxe room we were allocated was dark and dingy with stained bedspreads. Because of this we paid 20 a night extra to move into new block.
The Hotel facilities are not up to catering for the number of rooms,now over 100 not 66 as advertised. We had to take all-inclusive as there was no alternative but we didnt eat much as the buffet food was hardly warm. I think this prevented us getting ill as many of the guests were suffering from tummy problems.The general cleanliness in the restaurant and bar areas was poor dirty tables etc.So we ate elsewhere a lot of the time,the Ganesh Shack on the beach is very good.
We never used the sunbeds or pool as with 220 guests and 40 sunbeds there was no chance and whole area much too crowded. Except for two nights the evening entertainment was almost non-existant.
In all a very badly Managed Hotel where even the Waiters went on strike after New Year.
I would not return or recommend",0
731,"2 am arrival in the morning did not help, room sad and not all that clean in need of update safety is not recognised at this hotel as we found out during our stay only 1 bar and restaurant open the whole of the stay but they did have a bbq 1 night a week by the pool, constant working going on for two weeks putting covers over the air conditioning units (screws and nails left lying around) a bit annoying,pool steps broken replaced on our last day had to move our sun bed getting showered with lumps of concrete debris fell into pool and not cleaned away.drinks that had been spilt were never washed away at night sticky in the morning
it was the time of the year when they trimmed the palms it was amazing watching the lad climb the palm tree but not when they just missed a guest with the coconuts dropping as i said safety is not recognised.
on our anniversary prommised surprise on arrival still waiting 
only 1 bar and resturant open the whole of the stay
gym not open
thats the bad bit over
they did have a bbq 1 night a week,
food was good and if you asked the chef he would cook anything you desired within reason as we found out 
the waiters were top class could not do enough for you RAKESH AND ZAVED stood out
entertainment needs improvement
in house tailor ravi (be happy) very good if you want it he can make it reccomend the silk shirts
stayed all inclusive
would possibly go back but not all inclusive and definatley not with hayes and jarvis
eating out very good went to the curry and grills restaurant just outside hotel a few times as we love our sea food had lobster out of this world cooked to perfection it looked too good to eat but we did and half the price of the hotel (book before you go) and please do not do what some people do and not turn up after booking",0
732,I booked this hotel and stayed from 8 feb to 11feb 2014. I booked this resort looking at the amazing reviews here but when I finally reached the hotel on 8th of Feb 2014 I was told that there is no room for me & they asked me to stay in a nearby hotel. Since I had booked this hotel on makemytrip.com I spoke to makemytrip.com and finally after a big argument with the resort guys I finally got my room but it was already late in the evening and my entire day was wasted. I was very dissatisfied with this resort. Had high hopes on this resort but not worth of going again. Hotel staff always give priority to foreign guests in my case too they had allotted my room to a foreigner only after I asked for a refund then they gave me a room. Will never return back to this place not worth of.,0
733,"These were one of the rare vacations, where it was our bad luck to stay in this hotel. The hotel reeks of poor maintenance and care all around. The service was poor. Feedback is not taken in good spirit. The crowd was mostly rowdy group of drunk youngsters who gave a two hoot to peace of other guests and management allowed it. Family travellers please stay away. Still it could have been managed, if food had been good. Breakfast used to be ok, but dinner was unpalatable and undigestable with half cooked chicken, dishes having no salt. On pointing out the chef said ""if salt has been left out by mistake, please put it from shaker on your table. Overall bad experience and no value for the money.",0
734,"We stayed at Whispering for 3 nights /4 days and I have to say we were overall disappointed with the major contributions to our disappointment being :
1. This was the biggest - we were bitten by mosquitoes in this place every where and at all times of the day. The restaurant and the sitting areas around the pool had mosquitoes and other insects all through the day and ate us during breakfast, lunch evening and night hours. 
2. The staff ( besides the manager Subba who tried to help us as much as he can) was very negative and unfriendly and their first response always used to be 'no we can't/we don't ' . This I feel is a big dampner for guests at a place like this. 
3. The place had hot water only between 6-10 am and 6-10 pm. 
4. They had 1 wi-fi per room limit ( does that qualify fr wi-fi?) and that , by the way, barely really worked.
5. The pictures give an impression of a very cool and chic property where as it is a very ordinary property with ordinary rooms , baths being small and ordinary.
6. The good thing is they had some entertainment in the evening and some pool table etc. although it was disappointing that the pool was charged at Rs 150/frame. 

On the good side, the staff at restaurant was helpful and tried their best to help the guests. Jawed was our server most times and he was very sweet. The breakfast spread was great and we enjoyed it every morning. 

Overall, u can choose to stay here but then it being Goa, there are many better places available at this rate is my verdict !",0
735,"I visited this hotel quiet a while ago back in November 2012 the hotel was going through a renovation just before we went and a friend who I traveled with asked the manager himself if this was still happening as we were worried it would affect out stay as some reviews on here complained about the pool being closed ect. Anyway the manager ensured my friend that the renovation was over and would be by the time we went which was a lie!! When we got there and settled in our room (which we weren't happy with explain later) there was renovation going on outside out room!! It was a terrible view of building and was so unattractive to look at!! Anyway the reason we wasn't happy with our room was because it only had two beds and there was three of us staying!! The room was tiny so they moved us to a bigger room which yet again only had two beds, they told us not to worry and would bring us a bed up, when they did it was basically a scrawny piece of wood and a extremely slim could hardly pass for a mattress. The third person was unhappy with this and would of rather slept on the sofa thing because it was so uncomfortable so we had the extra bed removed. Which is really not the point because for the amount we payed for to stay at this hotel we would expect a room full of three beds, three comfortable bed DECENT BEDS but no we didn't want to complain too much because the staff dosnt seem to understand. Every morning there just didn't seem to be enough sun beds we would have to count on other people to save some for us before they ran out. The pool bar wasn't available when we stayed which it was advertised on the websites. They say on the websites that they have an animation team which they didn't, no activities went on during the day time it was boring!! There was a few entertainment in the night which weren't great. Most of the time it was a ""one man band"" which couldn't even sing properly and to be honest was rubbish. The food was terrible we ended up going out every night to the cheap resturaunts around the hotel because the food was that bad, they didn't have a range of foods I know it's in India but it was all Indian food nothing else. And just as we were leaving they opened another resturaunt which was chargeable!! In a all inclusive hotel!! We never went because we knew we would of been extremely disappointed as was the stay at the hotel. To sum up unless there has been any changes the hotel was boring although beautiful they didn't know how to entertain their guests in the day time there wasn't much to do apart from sit in the sun or swim in the pool, there was a pool table which is okay but that's it. No other falicities were available at our stay and it just felt like a big waste of money to us. I wouldn't suggest this hotel unless it has changed which I highly doubt that. There was a lot of promises on the websites and none of them were made.",0
736,"Ignore this at your peril, the evening meal was very poor most of the guests were ill, a lot of Brits stopped going in the restaurant in the evening, and having snacks at 1700hrs, burger n chips or something like that, all the bottles of beer Igot were out of date , I paid a lot of money to go here what a let downi will not return here",0
737,"firstly let me say that the hotel has been refurbed and to a very good standard, the rooms were clean and had all the facilities we required....HOWEVER our holiday soon became a bit of a nightmare due to being ill...... Now we have been to Goa before so everyone expects ' Delhi Belly' but what we experienced here was much worse. On our first evening there we went into the main restaurant area myself and my husband had a small portion of curry each and my Step son chose not to eat because there was nothing he liked the look of. So the next morning we went to the pool area and several people asked us if we had been ill yet and went on to describe how virtually all the complex had been ill and the doctors had been in giving people injections, people were loosing 3 and 4 days of their holiday and also being hospitalised, however we felt we would be ok as we are fit and healthy and not usually to badly affected.....Oh how wrong we were we spent the next 48 hours in bed being sick and upset stomach ( but our step son was fine) . In the brochure in the room it said reception had a range of medication so eventually my husband phoned for some help as we could not get to the chemist..he was told abruptly 'no we can't help'...So that was our one and only meal and drink at Whispering Palms, the general feel around the hotel was that the kitchens should be closed and completely cleaned down but that was never going to happen..
When we finally surfaced 2 days later we spoke to a lady who was customer services along with several other people and she tried to tell us we had FLU...I can assure you that was not flu.

It took me 7 days of my holiday before I felt well again and able to go anywhere without worrying about the toilet locations.

Other areas that need clarifying with this hotel is what is included in the 'All Inclusive' we asked on our first day about the A La Carte restaurant and were told we didn't get it, then perhaps we would get it but would have to pay 25 or 50% of the cost but they would get back to us needless to say they didn't...Also on the second to last night of our holiday we were sat with a couple who had travelled on exactly the same package as us when the waiter bought her husband an Irish Coffee, my husband said could he have one and was told we would have to pay???? we asked to see the manager to clarify this and he was not on site but I spoke to him myself and he agreed to meet us the next day at 11AM... we waited in reception but he did not keep to the meeting we asked the staff who made some calls and the only person who came to talk to us was the asst kitchen/restaurant manager, who's English was limited and all he kept saying is you can order burgers....so he obviously did not understand our issues.

This hotel is not cheap to go to and if like us you have to eat out everyday it becomes quite a costly holiday luckily we had taken money with us..

Would I book this hotel again I'm afraid not, just to say if you look at my previous reviews I am not a serial complainer so for me to do this review is unusually.",0
738,"Stayed Whispering Palms 8th to 23rd nov Checked the brochures saw the professional photos and read the reviews i think i went to the wrong hotel.Got are modern medium sized room with its tiny wardrobe.Had breakfast and went to check out the facilities. No whirlpool now tiled over.looked for the pool bar now a mini garden .Looked for the garden full of sunbeds now a two storie building in it was a bar but not open while i was there.There is now a full length walkway along the side of the pool that had numerous sunbeds before.We went to get our sunbeds there were 10 due to numerous complaints it was increased to over 30.Iwent to find the spa none there.I looked for the a la carte it wasn,t built.I looked for thesports bar not there.I think we went at the wrong time it was the indian christmas for two or three nights nowhere to sit or eat the hotel was full.The food was very bland 90 per cent curry but it is india we mostly ate out.A waste going A/I cheap to eat out.Some of the staff were great a lot like new starters.When leaving we asked to pay for a room extension not possible hotel full use the one toilet we were told due to many people complaining they gave us one.On are last day new sunbeds arrived pluss a load of tables and chairs and guess what the a-la-carte was finished.It can only get better.I was told one of the top men had left with a lot of his staff but maybe coming back not like me.Met some great people love to Hilary and Tony and the mad snipper Paul and Hilary.",0
739,"i had been in whispering palms resort from 14th to 17th nov, 2012 on map packege. The first impression was extremely bad...i had booked the packege of studio suit the highest catagory...after airport pickup , we reached the resort at 3 pm...they kept me waiting till 330 and then gave the terrace room...that was lower catagory...i opposed and shouted and then manager mr kedar came and game the studio suit....however, his behavior was not so good...but, later he realized and apologized.....room condition was not that good...the stuio suit was around 33 sq m in size, but there was 1.5 tonne window ac...the old and very bad working ac....i was exhausted....
food was ok......pool was smaller.....what else i can say....my room no was 421. however, some hotel rooms were refurbished...but, mine was not....i had booked 130 days in advabce...still older rooms were given...this was the height of cheating....",0
740,"Had planned a stay in the hotel for a week starting 1st of October. We visit Goa almost every year and are quite familiar with the places, Candolim being our favorite destination for food and stay. We picked this hotel for the location and after reading some decent looking reviews. We made the bookings over the phone and spoke to the sales lady about the facilities. Since we knew that during the off season specially the month of August and September a lot of hotels get renovated, I asked her specifically many times if the pool and other facilities would be available. She told me beside the Jacuzzi all the facilities were available. I made the bookings with the booking amount wire transferred. We reached the hotel around 9.30 in the morning, we knew we were early but were willing to wait till the check in time. Upon arrival we could see people coming out of the hotel in their swim wear and headed out of the hotel gate. We just wondered what was happening. Upon arrival we saw that the reception had been set up in a small room and hotel was under big time renovation. We asked them again if all the facilities were available and they told us that they have arranged for a swimming pool in a near by hotel. We took a chance to see where that other pool was and we were taken there in a car. Just imagine the hotel expects you to change into your swim wear, get to the road, hop on into a car and go to a nearby hotel for a swim. We didn't waste much time to ask for a refund of our money cause the holiday mood was already spoilt. We could see the hotel under big time renovation with one side of the hotel broken down and rebuilt, we could imagine the kind of stay and food they would have offered. Upon insisting and after making several call we managed to get the refund for booking amount.
Since we knew Goa and specially Candolim we managed to find another Hotel. But I pity someone who is new to Goa and had to go through such an experience. Just want to caution other travelers to be ready in such situations where the hotel cheats you and expects you to do with one start facilities after selling a four star price. We are not going to choose this place doesn't matter what time of the year we travel. 

PS : Goa is a wonderful place and we have been to some great hotel with great staff. Wish other travelers a great experience too.",0
741,"I saw the pictures and the reviews and thought this would be best of hotel I can get but when I went my dreams were broken. 
The property is not big at all.its a small place with a tiny un plasenent lobby area.dirty and messy.
Rooms are good size and clean. That's the only positive point.
Swimming pool is like a dirty pond of a village. I have seen both men and women in full cloths in the pool.ladies in suits and men's with shorts and t shirt.never ever I have seen this.if you use the pool you will fall sick so we dint for our stay.
I told the staff but they were not interested. They even suggested to jump in the pool with cloths.shocking.
Food is average and nothing special. They are far from to beach which is also not great.
Overall they spoiled our holiday and I suggest this hotel not worth the money it charge.",0
742,"Experience was not that great, though food taste/quality was decent. Rooms were pretty untidy and it didn't give the comfort feeling at all. View is not good,it wasn't at least from my room - 107.

In spite of mentioning the flight time, no airport drop was arranged. When we tried confronting, there was a lot of argument. 

Worst, they provide a room service, however, if the food falls on the bedsheet, they charge for it. Well, in that case a table should be provided or else the room service should be withdrawn.",0
743,"We booked this resort after seeing its pictures on various sites, but it was a big disappointment.

While the property is good and very well located but the kind of people / staying there practically made it a non-family location. We did raised this issue thereand wanted to check out but nothing happened. The food was average, pool was unusable due to the kind of people checked in.

The only good part was the front office, which did a good job. But overall it was a disappointment to us.",0
744,"location was excellent, however the review is average. there is lots of potential to make this better. we have used this as back up stay for othur goa visit. the service ask okay and enjoyed stay nothing to report about",0
745,"stayed here January 2015 there is no whirlpool just a few pathetic jets at one end of pool no patisserie shortage of sunbeds the"" regulars"" get up at 7am to put towels on chairs. The food was average. Rooms very clean .Staff were helpful . Near beach with lots of good shacks and shops .Good standard for Goa",0
746,"Good location, walking distance from the nice Sinquerim beach.

The 1 room suite to which we were upgraded to was quite unimpressive and stuffy. Hot water in bathroom had to be looked into late at night.

Service too was a let down. Delayed and clueless taxi pickup from airport, incorrect room service after everything was over resulting in no correction despite being told of ill-health of one guest was the last straw.

No value for money. We exited early and changed our hotel.",0
747,"Good points.... 
1.excellent location very close to shops and beach 
2. Lovely spacious rooms 

Bad points.... 

1. Very very bad wifi almost non existent, left me stuck a couple of times when needed. They tell everyone there is a network problem that will be fixed in the morning. Rubbish 
2. Booked twin room got a double, had to wait until next day for a twin to be available and during that night housekeeping were in corridor working outside the room all night. 
3. New room toilet flush kept breaking, took 3 call outs to solve. 
4. If you are not out of bed with a towel on a sunbed by 7am forget it, good ones gone even earlier. 
5. No where near enough food variation, it was curry for breakfast lunch and dinner so if you prefer English food you are screwed. To be fair the manager did say I could request anything I want if there was nothing I liked but this was only after several nights of going hungry then having to complain. This should have been made more clear. 
6. Broke a wheel on my case dragging it down side street to hotel, staff with trollies not expecting tips would be a huge help. 
7.flies everywhere!! (This is everywhere in India so don't want to be unfair to the hotel, but literally could not eat a single meal or drink a drink without a fly having landed on it the second it was served)
8. Evening entertainment APPALLING! Most nights were the cheap option of karaoke and others were just locals who couldn't sing for toffee wailing into a microphone and then asking if anyone wants to buy a CD. Something tells me the hotel don't even pay for this. It was also directly outside our room and went on until 11pm. 
9.we went to Delhi for a 2 night stay and upon telling the hotel they asked for a 'favour' could we give up our room whilst gone because they were short on rooms. How?? And why should we pack our entire room up when we had already paid for them two nights regardless of wether we were there or not. 
10. We checked out at 12noon and pick up for not until 9.30pm, there was no safety room all cases were just laid in the lobby, not safe! 

Staff are very average at this hotel, I have read reviews saying 5* service, I am not sure where these people have previously stayed but they have clearly never experienced actual 5* service if they think this is it. Staff stood back and watched me struggle to cart my case down loads of steps, we regularly sat at breakfast waiting to be asked if we want tea or coffee for a long time! The one member of staff I would like to commend is a young lad shantanu behind reception very helpful and friendly. 

All in all I loved goa and would return but not to this hotel which is such a pity as it is lovely in other aspects but for me service is everything.",0
748,"Myself and a friend stayed here for 10 days and from the moment we arrived until the moment we left it was terrible. They put us in a double room not a twin and wouldn't move us until the morning. There were dirty cups with tea in them outside the room and staff were up and down the stairs and in and out of the cupboard next to the room so we barely slept. After moving us the next day the room seemed fine. It was spacious and very clean (very good housekeeping). The toilet however broke three times, twice during the night so they couldn't fix it so we were left with loud trickling water and no flush. The wifi was terrible throughout the whole of our stay. They always said it would be fixed in the morning but it never was. Other guests complained about this too. There isn't much food choice and most of it was indian which became very harsh on the stomach towards the end of the holiday and made me quite ill. What they don't tell you is there is a snack menu where you can order other food. If we had have known this then maybe things would have been better but they do not make it known that it is available. My friend was unable to eat most of the food and got upset as she was hungry and was eating the same thing every day. I am not a fussy person with food at all but even I thought the choice was poor. The milk was also off a lot leaving floaters in our tea so we couldn't drink it. We went to Delhi for two nights and left the key at reception only to be asked a 'favour' to have our room while we were gone as they were short. I found this very unprofessional considering we had paid for the room and they shouldn't be over booking. When we tried to exchange money at reception I was short by 30 rupees and my friend by 300 so please watch out for this and count before you leave reception. We both found the staff quite rude, never smiling and we didn't get one apology when we brought up any problems. At one point there were four members of staff including the manager at reception and not one of them attempted to help us when we were stood waiting patiently. One of the waiters also asked us at night if we wanted to go to the beach which absolutely should not have happened! Our lift to the airport after checkout was at 9:30pm so we checked out only to be told there was no storage room and suitcases were just left in the reception area so we worried all day. We had to shower in the spa which was smelly and dirty. We did use the spa previously for treatments and it seemed fine then but the treatments were no where near as described and they also told us on booking that we would get 20% off but then told us on paying that this was only for a full body massage. Everything is to get money from you. Guests do not come first, their money does. This is fine as it is a business however an honest and higher standard of service would mean we would have considered returning however they have now lost our custom as we will not be returning to this hotel. The beach is a two minute walk...probably one of the only positives.",0
749,"This resort is not what I would call a resort. Firstly when we arrived at 6pm, we were informed that our room would not be ready till 8:30pm as guest that was checking out was still in the room. Found that weird considering checkout it 12pm but I did figure out why this was the case, You can ask for a late checkout, but after 3pm they charge you for a full day. So they, say yes to the guest, that they can stay in the room, charge them full day rate and then make the checking in guest wait. That way they get double the money for that room for that day, not caring about the person checking in at all. This was very frustrating but not much that we could do. Wifi internet was included but you could only be connected to one device. To get you access code, reception could not help you as they needed to get their manager and he was not at work at the time I called. Had to wait till he returned to work before I was able to get an access code and even then the internet was extremely slow and unreliable as it kept dropping out. This so called resort is not for young people. The crowd at this resort was an older crowd and lots of families with kids. On the first day in our room, the air-conditioning stopped working and had to move room. TV in our first room was old and damaged. It had permanent lines running through the screen. We paid for a Suite Room (their best room) but the bathroom was old and not very nice and needed a major upgrade. We saw the basic room, which looked better than the suite rooms, which makes no sence and requested to move to the basic room. Once we moved to the basic room, we were happier as it was better than the suite. The power at the resort in general kept cutting out. We would be watching tv and then the power would cut out, everything would go off for a few seconds and then it would start again. This happened a lot and was extremely frustrating. The resort would do housekeeping at 12:30am (yes, in the middle of the night), making loud noises, waking guests up. When I asked them to keep the noise down as we were trying to sleep, they didn't care and it just seemed to get worse. Who in their right mind cleans resort rooms and passage ways in the moddle of the night? The only positive thing I can say about this resort is that we took on the all-inclusive package (Full Board). Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner and Snacks throughout the day were all pretty good with only the occassional hit and miss.",0
750,"I know this is a little late to review, but I had to. This was a family get together with around 30 of us in the month of October 2014 that we visited Whispering Palms. We had around 15 rooms booked and I thought, considering the number of people we were, we would be given rooms which would not only make our vacation of 2 nights and 3 days enjoyable but would also give Whispering Palms a good chance to spread the word and publicize about it.

We had rooms in the main building where the reception area was. The rooms were clean and well kept, but after a day when we saw the rooms which were near the Aahata restaurant, the rooms not only faces a beautiful landscape but were also quiet and nicer, which completely disappointed me. Every night, there used to be some check-in and since my room was located above the reception area, it used to get very noisy and irritable. The second day had no hot water coming in my and my other family members' bathrooms. The worst part was there was a small sitting area with one sofa and 2 chairs near the reception which most of the guests in the hotel used to fight for. Considering the number of rooms they had in the hotel, they should have atleast made some decent arrangement for people who check-in and hang out, when not in their rooms. With food, you are lucky if you are going for a buffet, but not otherwise. On the day we left our flight was at 3pm so we thought we would have lunch and go and it took the waiter almost an hour to get our order. And all that we ordered was rice and fish curry.

The best part about the hotel was the walk to the market, beach and pool, which the kids and others enjoyed.

I don't think I would recommend and go again to Whispering Palms, highly disappoi",0

The rooms were passable but grubby and tired IE grime in corners of the bathroom walls and floor in the tiling joints etc, just seemed like a quick wipe cleaning was carried out. The food was passable but not great. The staff were very pleasant though.
Rated as 4* but more like a decent 2*. Would not go back, right on the beach though.
I suppose it is India though.",0
754,"Very congested resort, lacks basic policy enforcement for guests at swimming pool on dressing sense, regret going there with my family.

Like we are willing hire a private number car for see sighting for goa because taxi numbers vichle is not available and hotel management refused to give a parking in hotel and we saw foreigners also hire private number Mahindra Thar they will get the parking in hotel we do lots of discussion about this with management but they don't get give the permission of parking, I think if are Indian please skip this hotel, this hotel only service to foreigners only. They also open pub for foreigners at mid late night. But if u r Indian they giving only a book of hotel rules and regulations. They don't give a any kind of service or hospitality.",0

were limited food choice but next day it was ok as far as north indian food is concerned . Hotel should not be catering to local only , should be equally be caring to all the guest. would not refer to my family and friends",0

759,"We ended up at this hotel having booked very last minute due to our original trip arranged to Egypt having been cancelled 

Our room was fine , clean, good shower and air con and these were our main priorities

House keeping wasn't great and on one day - room wasnt cleaned

We didn't use the rest of the hotel very much at all - although we were all inclusive - the hotel really wasnt somewhere we wanted to spend time.

There were a lot of children round the pool which put us off 

So instead went to the beach every day which is 5 min walk. Similarly we went out to eat every evening 
We did have breakfast in the hotel on two mornings and it was adequate as were the all inclusive drinks . Goa is so cheap and lots of choice so you really don't need all inclusive 

There seemed to be plenty of choice at meal times but only from one Buffet - dirty floors and food everywhere splashed around the hot plates - most off putting

Entertainment in the evenings (we only saw on our way in or out) was cheesy and not my thing at all

The staff were all polite, helpful and keen to assist although the cleaning staff were clearly trying to get a tip out of us on the last day and kept coming back to the room and hassling us

I had a watch go missing from the room during the stay and when reported to staff they were totally dismissive - not good at all !

They also insisted on us paying 30 to keep the room from midday (normal check out) to 8pm - a liberty given that we hardly had anything from the hotel over the week. The air conditioning also broke on the last day and wasnt repaired.

Goa was a complete delight and the people were lovely - outside of the hotel - would not return to the hotel ",0
760,"Hotel was ok. Enjoyed the Breakfast. Housekeeping staff were fantastic. Room service food was amazing too.
But Music is too loud. One of the nights there were only 5 people dancing, I don't understand the necessity of the music to be that loud for such small crowd. It wasn't even pleasant music.
Forget about Hotel Wi-fi. they said they're upgrading the service, but said we're able to access slow internet. Rang the reception like 7 times and we were given 5 different passwords, none of them worked. Got sick of them calling them and just had to stick with out mobile phones.
On the day we were checking out, it took 45 mins to complete the checkout process. Their EFTPOS (credit card reader) machine isn't working. we had to go out to 4 different ATM's to withdraw the cash. Even though this is not entirely Hotels fault, i would've expected a simply apology, but got nothing. 
Rs 120 for playing pool ? It's ridiculous. we paid nearly 90k during our stay at the hotel but seriously charging 120Rs for pool is bad.
Walk way to our room stunk like sewage.",0
761,"I went to Palm beach resort acting on advice of online reviews and friends. But, I am disappointed to say that it does not offer the facilities it boasts. Though the property is quiet decent & located at stone throw distance (literally) from Condolim beam, still it lacks some basic features like poor service level, be it peak breakfast hours, or late lazy afternoons.

Also had encounter with some other nuisance guest, who were totally drunk and were creating trouble both for hotel staff as well as other guests sitting by the pool. In fact hotel staff had to ask 3 - 4 other couples to leave that area to avoid any embarrasing situation to arrive. We were just two girls with few otherfriends, and it was not a pleasant experience.

I think a positive response from the hotel staff would had been to make those people leave the hotel there and than in the middle of the night to create reassurance to other guest that hotel is fully committed to their safety and comfort.

Overall not very happy with the hotel, would not recommend to my other couple friends or gals travelling alone.",0
762,"Hotel was in a poor state needing to be done up,ie tiles on floor all cracked,only 1 communial toilet ,1 swimming pool .bathrooms floor flooded,and there had been people that had slipped.
The al a'cart was 1 set menue ,and was boring after a while.Eating out was very cheep,so we ate out alot.The beach was not far but your not all inclusive there you pay for your drinks and food,The sea was very dangerus to swimm in big waves and strong current ,so not much swimming in the sea just paddle,which disapointed me.The serving staff waiters very good and worked hard friendly.We injoyed our trips jungle book and castaway,but the jurney to them in the buses was so uncomfortable.",0
763,"Just come back from this hotel having spent christmas and new year their.
We were very disappointed on arrival, and disgusted with the room, which was so small, and the balcony had a big air/con unit, which made it impossible to go onto the balcony..
The facilities decribed were not available in the room, no mini bar, no air dryer, no electrical adapter, all of which are listed as being in all rooms.

We were moved to another room the next day, which was larger, with a better bathroom, but nothing like the pictures on the internet. We became aware, that others customers were being moved following complaints, and the lucky ones got the luxury rooms.One of the other guests showed us their room, which was much nicer than ours, but they told me they had paid extra for the room when they arrived.

Some of the staff were very helpful, others wanted to be tipped before providing a good service.

The breakfast and snacks were good, but we found the evening food to be poor and we ate out most nights.

The swimming pool was in need of a makeover and a good clean.

Not an hotel i would recommend or return to.",0
764,"If you are expecting a 4 star hotel you will be sadly disappointed as we were. This is at most a low end 3 star. Inadequate supply of towels, electricity, and hot water. Yes it's a great location and luckily we spent most of our time outdoors. The pictures they provide must have been when it initially opened or they were enhanced. Electricity is turned off when not occupied which causes a musky smell.",0

1. A/C : not effective and event burnt during night time
2. Food : not available on day1.
3. Room service : too slow and even forget the order. strange
4. Reception - no ideas of how to say yes and no for anything.
5. Rooms were not ready to check in and no room freshners they use by default.",0

This is the worst hotel we have stayed in for food quality. meals are served buffet style, and if you like to eat later in the evening, its mush. rooms were ok, be aware not all rooms have a balcony. Location great, just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of calangute. Would not reccomend this hotel to anyone, there are far better ones in the same area.",0
768,"Having had a few holidays in Goa in the past it was great to return! The whispering Palms is a very good all inclusive resort. The food, drinks, service and entertainment were all excellent. If I had a complaint at all it would be our reluctance to leave the resort and explore Candolim. Rooms are basic but clean and comfortable with noisy but efficient air-con. The location is great only a couple of minutes from the beach and town centre. If you wish to purchase Daily English newspapers, Magazines, books - travel books in particular there is a fab little shop opposite Highland Resort and next to the elephant shop - Hira Shopping Mart, Ramish Govecar the proprietor is an true local and a gentleman, his brother Raj gave us a great day out on one of his tours at a fraction of the cost of some of the hotel prices - he is a quiet and unassuming fellow who allowed us to enjoy freedom on our own without interferance but was always on hand for assistance. The Whispering Palms is a lovely friendly hotel which made us feel very welcome and we would return tomorrow if it wasn't for the desire to try somewhere different each time",0
769,food qulaity is Okay not that great mostly people are there with the pacakages which are not that attractive,0
770,"This hotel is nothing as shown in the photos on the website. The photos make the hotel out to be a lot larger than it really is. The entrance to the hotel is half way down a narrow lane to the beach. Behind metal gates and a high wall.
The room was one of the classic rooms which was nice and also the gardens round the room was kept to a high standard and were very pleasant. The laundry in the room was a bit, hit and a miss. Also told the room was to far from the boiler for hot water. This was put right, sort off; the water was only hot from 8.30- 9.00am and 6.30 - 7.00pm. 
The reception area, dining room, pool area and bar were very small. There was only one toilet and one urinal plus basin in the mens toilet to service all these areas. This is a hotel with 106 rooms, approx. 230 persons when full, as what it was when we were there. 
The pool area did not have enough sun beds and the pool was oily and needed repair.
From the fourth day we didn't use the restaurant other than for breakfast because the food was mostly cold, very poor service and no tablecloths on the tables, except for plastic place mats.
The service at the bar was slow due to bar staff having to duplicate your order onto order pad, which you had to sign for. Also when you ordered from a waiter the order was nearly always wrong. 
The evening entertainment was Third-rate and on a weekly rotation.
The management was also looking for guest to go to South Goa at weekends so they could let out your room to business guests from Mumbai.
No hotel towels are allowed on the beach so you need to take your own towels and the beach is about 4mins walk from the hotel. The beach is sandy but could be cleaner. It also has a cargo ship beached on the beach, which has been there for 10 years.
Plus points for the hotel is that its very central for all amenities, buses and taxis. There is some excellent restaurant around the hotel. At very reasonable prices and catering for all tastes, with all selling excellent seafood.
Also had my teeth and eyes tested at prices much cheaper than the U.K?

Liked  GARDENS
Disliked  POOL AND AREA AROUND THE POOL",0
771,Horrible is the word for their breakfast. i have not had worse breakfast anywhere else. Though the rooms are ok for the price and bathroom clean..still nothing extraordinary about the resort..there are many other options in Goa that you can have for this price..,1
772,"Stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. The hotel is 5 minutes walk away from the Candolim beach and is surrounded by several good cafes. The rooms are well maintained and spacious. Breakfast spread was good and the service was quick. The staff was courteous and helpful. 
Overall, we had an exceptional experience.",1
773,"Lovely hotel, restaurant staff very attentive, delicious food.
Our room was above the reception area which was very noisy so we asked to be moved which took 2 days to sort out. Our room was spacious & clean. WiFi was a bit 'hit & miss'.
Entertainment in the hotel very good.

Pool area very nice & clean towels available all day by the pool.

Hotel just a 5 minute walk to the beautiful beach.",1
774,"This is a lovely hotel. The best aspect is the friendliness of the staff. They really try and find things they can do for you, nothing is too much trouble. Don't worry about calling the housekeeping service if you need anything for the room. I had my laundry done twice, and was impressed by the professional service (everything came back wrapped in tissue paper, felt very special). The bed was comfy and the shower powerful. If I am being picky, would say there is a shortage of drawers for the clothes of two people, but when I mentioned this, housekeeping brought us extra hangers. 

We had room 206 by the pool. The view from our balcony wasn't great, there is a new hotel due to be built and the land is fenced of. But it didn't really matter that much.

There is a library, which one of the managers brought me to, as it isn't that easy to find. There is a gym, but unfortunately, the equipment is very out of date and a bit risky health and safety wise.

Meals are great. Not sure what you would do if you don't like curry, but there are alternatives such as fish pie, and stews for those with a dislike for spice.

There is a very short walk to the beach. There are ladies on route who try and tempt you into their shops, but this is part of the fun. We were sold a few dodgy goods, which at home were found to be broken and trousers which leak dye. However, this is a poor country and we didn't mind forking out a few pounds for reminders of our holiday. We had some good banter with the shop keepers!

Should mention that we met many guests who have been going back to Whispering Palms every year for many holidays, that says a lot about the hotel. 

I hated leaving and wished we could have stayed for two weeks rather than ten days. Th

We went on two trips with a local tour guide, Rafi, who loves Goa so much it is infectious. Talking of health matters, we didn't have any stomach upsets at all. I had four mosquito bites in 10 days, so as long as you have spray, seems to be fine as the hotel take precautions to ensure mosquitoes are zapped.

I don't think I have said enough to describe how lovely it is. There are many rooms and some are in gardens, so try and find out what room you will be in before you go. After an 9 hour flight you wouldn't want to argue about accommodation. In short, this hotel suited us and the people we are We felt we were in India, rather than in a 5 star luxury palace. Well done to the managers and staff .",1
775,"We had a fantastic short holiday in Whispering Palms, can't wait to go back again. Hotel staff was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. The food was great throughout with a lot of variety. The evening entertainment including the Goan cultural evening was very enjoyable. Thank you all the staff, especially Vinda that made our holiday so special. Our room was very clean...
",1
776,"Its a nice place to stay, very near to beach (not rushy beach), food is good but prepared taking international tourists in mind, a bit less on Indian taste, nice swimming pool, tatva spa is also very good and lastly its location is fantastic............ I suggest to have a stay over there.",1
777,garden can be more tidy and illuminated at night.mattresses are too loose.must be little hard as they are not comfortable.vegetarian menu for breakfast must have more varieties.Pickup drop from airport should be included in the package.,1
778,"WPH has always been safe, clean, good food with excellent around staff and managers.
Although the property could do with investment around the pool area the hotel gives you a great base if you want to use the all inc to a maximum or do as we do come and go as we please as their are lots of things to see and do in the area. If you ever have any problems the staff at the reception will do their best to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Even with the ongoing currency issues we struggled for one day but the restaurants and shacks will in most cases take Stirling or let you run a tab. Go to the Whispering Palms and give it a go. We did once and that was 13 times ago. Some of the music entertainment requires updating in my opinion, same songs for a long time.",1
779,"Everything was great, including the service, just a thing missing was the view from room... But the location is great, three minute walk to peaceful and clean sinquerim beach, and three minute walk to the main candolim street full of great cafes restaurants and shops",1
780,"Stayed here for a week in mid November. Good location and facilities. Staff friendly and helpful. Beach close by but only spent one afternoon there as the sea was a bit murky and some of the beach huts weren't open for business. There is lots to do in Candolim, great bars and restaurants and very inexpensive. We hired a motorbike for 3 days and visited Baga, Anjuna, dolphin point and Panjim. The traffic is something else but if you keep your wits about you, your eyes wide open and don't go too fast it's safe enough! We had a problem with money as the 100 and 500 rupee notes had just been taken out of circulation and it was difficult to spend the 2000 rupee notes as no one wanted to give change. We got shafted in Anjuna, given change of 3x 500rp and had to go to a bank to change them which was tedious. 
Hotel - very pleasant, spacious ground floor room with a terrace in the beautiful gardens. Food - varied and staff will cook anything for you if you don't like the buffet. Lots of curry (it's India!!) Food could have been hotter. 
Pleasant swimming pool but insufficient sun beds made worse that people were getting up and putting towels on beds before 6am (we're on holiday for goodness sakes!) Staff did seem to be able to conjure up more sun beds when asked.
Entertainment- nothing out of the ordinary but ok.
We had a very late flight home and the hotel let us keep our room until 2pm and then use the spa facilities for showering etc so we didn't need to pay to keep the room on. 
Laborious getting through immigration at the airport to come home - I think it was the first day of work for some of the staff ! We had to show our passports to every tom, dick and harry which became a bit of a joke.
Met some fantastic people at whispering palms, lots of repeaters. All in all, a lovely week in the sun and a great first taste of India.",1
781,"My best friend and I took on to celebrate our birthday in this beautiful resort. My friend had been here earlier and insisted that I should try it out too. it's a nice place they have so much to offer as far as entertainment is concerned. Yummy dinner was made even more special with live music . Beach is just a walk away. The place is affordable too.I would recommend it to peopen, it's value for money.",1
782,"Just had 2 weeks here. January/February. Hotel was clean. We did get a bit 'curried out' but the chef would cook something plain if you asked. Our room didn't have a view, but it had a great shower and always kept clean. We didn't see any of the animation team and the regular entertainment wasn't up to much, although the acrobats were fantastic, as was 'Carnival night'. Had a great holiday and would return to Candolim, I wouldn't go all inclusive again as there are plenty of nice, cheap places to eat out.",1
783,"Just come back from a 2 week stay and I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. Didn't expect the hotel to be as nice as it was. Very clean, rooms spacious enough. Staff were lovely. Excellent location for the beach. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",1
784,"Great meeting up with old friends , staff as always on the look out for anything they can do to make your holiday the best they can . If you need anything that isn't to your particular taste it is no problem for them to make something that is .",1
785,"once again we found the staff welcoming and attentive at all times .The hotels location is about perfectly placed between beach and shops-restaurants etc.After 25 years some of the older rooms are getting a little tired and could do with a little work,however this is overshadowed by the quality of the staff we will return again without doubt",1
786,"Clean tidy and caring environment. Food is alright for all inclusive, breakfast was very good but really could do with two toasters! Lovely pool but not enough room around it for the amount of guests. Access to the near by beach couldn't be better, must nearly be the best in Goa",1
787,"We spent 4 days in the resort in Feb'17, for celebrating our Fathers 75th birthday. The rooms are adequately spacious and well maintained, the terrace rooms are really good, especially ones facing the swimming pool. The first look at the reception and the corridors do not give a positive feel for the money you spend. But once you experience the ambiance, the food, the Tatwa spa the view changes for good. The staff is really helpful we interacted with Mr.Anurag Nair, who was courteous. They made arrangements for the birthday celebration beside the pool with live music. Food was really wonderful, with a good mix of Indian and continental. A good place to stay if you intent to stay put in a resort, the sea is just a 5min walk from the resort, The beach is clean and neat as well.",1
788,"I stayed there for 4 nights with my family last week. 
Rooms - were good enough to stay for a couple plus one small kid. Good and comfortable with all the amenities required like safe,mini bar,tea/coffee maker etc. 
wifi connection is good and i didn't get any issue with that. pool was not over crowded and you can enjoy with your kids as well as they have pool for kids too. food was excellent and have many option to try in breakfast and dinner as well. you can enjoy the food sitting in pool area 
enjoying the live performances/event. service was excellent - staff is always prompt and ready to provide good service. location is also good as it is in the main area of north goa and all the beaches are near by the location. candolim beach is just 10 mins walk drive from the resorts.",1
789,"We stayed for 2 weeks at this really good hotel. A great location in the quieter part of Candolim. The manager was very efficient in sorting us a lovely quiet room in the gardens and all of the staff without exception were friendly and helpful. The food was varied and good and the pool, bar and outdoor seating made for a sociable setting. We didn't make the most of the all inclusive package as we love the beach, lunch at beach shacks and there are some fantastic restaurants in walking distance but its all so cheap it didn't matter - we just dipped in and out where we chose. One or 2 things to mention - you can take the hotels towels to the beach, very few of the standard rooms have much of a view, just ask if you want poached eggs (!), a sunbed or an umbrella on your terrace, sunbeds are all claimed very early morning, the tailor on site is very good. Would happily recommend Whispering Palms.",1
790,"Sheer delight packed into just one week - our first time at Whispering Palms, Goa....

Our family of three had only one week in mid-February for a break from cold, wintry UK. After searching via the Internet and contact with travel agents, we decided that Goa was the ideal location with direct flights from the UK to match the available dates. Among the options in North Goa (Candolim in particular) we eventually booked the Whispering Palms Beach Resort as it had good reviews and was ideally located.

Our first choice of a room with a balcony accommodating three was unavailable on arrival at 3am, but the staff were very helpful with moving us into our preferred room as soon as it became available.

We found the facilities on offer excellent, the short walk to the beach, the local shops, free WiFi, etc. a bonus. The staff were without exception courteous, friendly and so helpful - no stone left un-turned in making our short stay as enjoyable as possible. 

The breakfast, lunch and dinner cuisine was varied and plentiful with excellent entertainment in the evenings and we had no hesitation with inviting friends and family to join us at a modest additional cost.

Many thanks to all the staff at Whispering Palms for your excellent service. Hoping to see you again next year.",1
791,"As a frequent traveler the overall trip to Candolim was 'ok' but the hotel staff really made our trip. We came as two big 'loud' families with lots of kids and we felt nothing but welcomed by all the staff.

Although in need of updating or even a little clean, they do have TWO baby high chairs, which as we've learned in Candolim is pretty unheard of as most places have non or at the most just one. 

Pools are very clean with a separate toddler pool. 
Food is good and if there is something you want that isn't on the menu they are more than happy to make it fresh. 

As valentines fell during our trip I asked the staff to make private arrangements for flowers and balloons in the room. They sneaked in whilst we were at breakfast and set it all up beautifully. 

I've had the chance to pop into a couple of other hotels on the top review list that we considered staying during my research as our friends (with no kids) are staying and I am so happy we made the right choice. 

The beach is practically on the doorstep. 
I recommend that once you get to the sand turn right and use Ryan's Shack. Less dogs, free beach beds if drinking/eating and great music with less disturbance from hustlers. 

Overall I can't see that you will find another hotel as good for close to the same price range in Candolim.",1
792,"I have had a fabulous experience at whispering Palms hotel. Every member of staff has been lovely , professional, anything requested however small was sorted. After travelling the world. I would highly recommend this resort. I have never encountered such happy obliging staff. The all inclusive package was excellent. Great food, drink and entertainment. Every member of staff is a credit to the hotel. I chose to spend several days on the beach with numerous shacks (beach bar/ restaurants) 1 min walk from hotel. The beach also was lovely and spacious. Our girls group had several days at Maya's and Ryans shacks. Maya's was peaceful. Ryans played incredible music from 5-till late, it was brilliant....great DJ 
I will definitely be going back to Goa, and will pre book Whispering Palms again. Sinitta, Vinda and all front of house staff were amazing, as were all of the staff. Thank you. 
whilst Goa is beautiful, there is a lot of poverty there, which is evident everywhere outside the hotel. Cows and dogs along the streets. It all added to the Goan experience. 
One of our group of girls has been going for 18 years, now I know why. I will be back Loved every minute.
We had a great holiday",1
793,"This is a very good property to stay.very clean and spacious rooms, food quality is excellent, very courteous staff. One of the best thing about this resort is it is located very near to candolim beach.Hotel organises live events in the evening. Has a very good swimming pool.Will definitely recommend everyone to choose this resort for a great experience.",1
794,"Had 2 weeks at the whispering phams in January, the staff are brilliant and look after your every need.
We have just booked to go back next January this time for 4, weeks and carnt wait.
So look forward to seeing you all and having another great holiday
Derek & Anne",1
795,"Just returned from a 2 week stay at this hotel. I found the rooms clean with a great maid service, tv and air con good. The All Inclusive was very good with all the main Goa beers and spirits available. Food has a very good selection with Indian and western food at every sitting.
Although I went to the beach 13 of my 14 days I noticed that the sunbeds are in short supply around the pool so most are taken by 7am.",1
796,"As with our first visit to Whispering Palms we stayed for 14 nights, all inclusive (booked through Thomas Cook). Our first stay was in one of the garden suites, and I must admit I was apprehensive about our second visit as we decided to go with the standard twin room - I need not have worried, the room was of an excellent size, the balcony was probably double the size of those of the garden suites, the only thing I would say is that although there is a lot of storage space for clothing there is very little hanging space and ladies, forget about anywhere for hanging dresses, mine had to go on the back of the bathroom door!

The food and entertainment were excellent, I can particularly recommend the vegetarian options, all were very good!

All the staff were as friendly and helpful as ever, we tried the room service this time and it more than lived up to expectations (be aware that room service is chargeable, even with AI). A special mention should go to the housekeeping team, nothing was too much trouble.

The resort is perfectly placed, 2 minutes from the main street in Candolim or 2 minutes from the beautiful beach and the Arabian sea.

During our 2 visits we have looked around other hotels but nothing has compared to Whispering Palms, 

We have fallen in love, both with Goa and Whispering Palms, so much so that we are flying back out on Christmas Day so that we can be there for the New Year celebrations.

Thanks to Jacob John and all his team, keep up the good work and we'll see you at Christmas!",1
797,whispering palms great location only a short walk to the beach. hotel food was amazing. the staff and management were first class. room service was prompt.house keeping was very efficient and courteous as were all the staff always smiling. we will deffinatly be returning again to this hotel thank you to everyone at the whispering palms who made our stay fantastic. only one issue the wine was terrible and the management was informed,1
798,We stayed for 10 days as did not know what to expect if Goa. Great holiday hotel short walk to beach food good rooms very clean. Great fun looking to book again January 2018 beach great attraction much tie spent jumping the waves. But good selection of buffet food each day.,1
799,"wonderful location, wonderful property and such courteous staff. Had an amazing time at the resort. Staff is so helpful at all hours.

Housekeeping staff is very courteous and efficient. We have small kids and even an infant with us. But never felt the need to escalate anything, everything was so prompt and accurate.

thank u team. keep up the good work.",1

Lovely swimming pool and dream surroundings while drinking your fresh coconut .",1
801,"After bringing up my concerns to the manager on duty , he just apologized and no action was taken. Insensitive i would say. Someone should be taking corrective action but i guess once the guest has checked out, they dont really care.",0
802,It was a waste of money ...hyatt as brand was not able to offer as per the brand image.it was expensive and the worst part was the hospitality...the staff at the dining room really sad very disappointed,0
803,Checked into the property on 18/12/2016. Room locks were not working. The phone had a message light which kept flashing despite following all instructions to deactivate the same. Response from maintenance was obnoxious. The duty manager and the GM did not bother to call despite escalation. This despite me being a platinum Hyatt member. Have 2 more nights at this property and really do not think i will enjoy the same.,0
804,"The most disgusting food and service . The Masala Dosa made had the filling of pakoris with chutney flowing into it .also they don't have an option of serving a stronger tea , that's what the guy serving told me when asking for one . The fruits served were absolutely non inviting and the staff is super busy to be disturbed .....",0
805,"The hotel is very beautiful and has the all comforts that a luxury hotel could have. I was there for my friend 's wedding on 22nd and 23rd of November. Everything was so great until something happened, something that a five star hotel couldn't allow. We went back twice into the room before the housekeeping cleaned the room and we left the second time a watch with a bracelet on the desk. After almost 1 hour we went into the room and we noticed that the bed was done and the room cleaned. Then we started to change because we needed to go to the wedding ceremony and my boyfriend didn't find the watch and the bracelet anymore where he left it. We looked for it everywhere, even in the drawers and my bag. NOTHING. I decided to the report the event to the hotel and they after one day they said they did all the investigations just asking to the housekeeping if she took the watch and obviously she said no. That's what they did! Just this! Unluckily we needed to live early in the morning so we didn't do or say anything more. We just went back home without an important and valuable gift that a five star hotel shouldn't allow to stole.",0
806,"Staff at the dining room is not fit for service industry, over all property is good but behaviour of staff spoiled my vacation. Total waste of time and money for me. No one was even interested to take feedback.",0
807,"There is nothing grand in this supposed luxury Hotel- terrible service, bland food, dogs and cats in the resort and beach, a pool that looks more like a fish pond and workers pointing rooms until 10.30 at night with a terrible smell of paint. No taxi available from reception to go into town and no help whatsoever with the recent banned rupees notes- what a disappointment.",0
808,"The location is terrible. It's quite isolated. If you'd like to visit any places you're forced to take the hotel's transport. The staff is unfriendly. They don't make you feel welcome. There is no beach. The pool isn't cleaned very day!! Towels aren't clean, even the room towels. Breakfast if very average and boring. They were 55 minutes late in allowing us entrance to a function. Frankly speaking, the hotel doesn't have anything to offer. The saddest thing though, is that the concierge recommends an elephant ride. Instead of an elephant haven, a group of men are holding 3 elephants chained with little food just to offer a 10-minute ride to the tourists. This should really be boycotted. What a shame for a 5* hotel to condone and even recommend such a behavior!!",0
809,"Words are not enough to describe this horrible experience. Rooms are hardly cleaned, the less said better for toilets! I found toiletries probably half used and left by previous user! Handling of luggage was deplorable and one wonders why should one actually even bother to stay in this hotel. I will renounce my Hyatt passport membership!",0
810,"Hi , I stayed in the hotel from aug 31 - Sep 6th . Actually I was planning to stay in Taj Goa. But reviews pulled me to Grand Hyatt . I would highlight my points serially . Till our checkin, everything was polite and cordial .I checked into a bay view room with price of 15,000 plus per day , including breakfast , for 5 days .
a) Day 1 - We checked into the room - On entering the room , the AC was not working properly;we checked in in the evening . While going to sleep , the lights above the bed were not getting off. Night 1 am we had to call , the electricial came, he took out the fuse from the mains for the 3 lights , told it would be rectified the next day . We told him A/c was not working , He opened the AC vent , told there is a lot of dust , and came and fixed it after cleaning it . ""now ur AC will work fine "" , He told . Isn't this something to expect from a five star hotel before hand .
b) Day 2 - Morning my family member was unwell . I went to the hospital , Morning my breakfast was complimentary. I told about the unwellness and told , i would be packing the breakfast . Reception told "" Yes Sir sure , No problem "" . When I went to the breakfast area , no such communication was made, The dining area ppl are asking me whom did you talk to ? Why should I remember .. Then after long time it was sorted out , and i could get some breakfast to my Room after lots of fight , We then started for the day in afternoon.
c) Day 3 - We went for our sight seeing , on coming back , the House keeping had changed the bedsheet and blankets . When we were about to sleep , at around 1 am .. We normally used to start in afternoon and return in night 11 around... The blanket had blood stains .. GoD knows , if ever one customer has menstrual cycle and blood has come to blanket .. How come you can put such blanket in another room . "" FIVE STAR HOTEL "" u say . Night 1 am the house keeping person came and changed the blanket . he didnt have the courtesy of fitting the new blanket.. Threw the new blanket on bed .. Took the blood stained blanket and went !!
d) Day 4 : Morning , we went on to make coffee with the Kettle !! God save me , The Kettle wasn't working . It was not getting on ... The Bed where we slept , The head rest had dust accumulated and none had cleaned it since 5 days ..The same day , I tried to open the tap in the Bath tub , rusted water came out of it ..We gave up..
e) Day 5 :: This was icing on the cake. I had booked bay view rooms for 4 days with complimentary breakfast . I extended the stay by another day , bay view room with no breakfast . Since the previous day , I went for a cruise along with family , I had asked the receptionist a day before , to remove the complimentary breakfast from 4th day , and club it to the additional 5th day . The receptionist - a lady , told us she would get back . she called back and told , Sir its done your complimentary breakfast is moved to the next day !! We would be intimating to the Dining section !!The same day nite , the day before check out , we went to reception for the next day Break fast .... But as expected ..nothing was done .. Questions like "" Whom did you talk to and all came "" .. nothing had been informed to dining ... and the day breakfast we skipped , has been put as present ??? Strange ... After much fight .. the Receptionist who talked to us told no.. I asked you to inform dining .. Where does a customer run around and inform the dining ,,, n all... Rubbish.. They spoiled our day .. we were returning happy from Baga beach ..Horrible experience !!

f) The Check out Day :: I was really pissed off with all these stuff... 6th morning , I went for checkout ..As if this was not the end of all.. My checkout bill... Had phone calls made from land line , worth some Rs.200 .. Rs.200 is not a big deal .. I never used the phone for local calls or std calls ... But know what , the house keeping people come to ur room and while cleaning the rooms make personal calls from phones and we have to pay for them . Why ??After much fight .. the receptionist , removed the calls from phone...


Pros :: Yes 2 good things 1) The Valet parking people were very cordial
2) Chullah Restaurant

GRAND HYATT GOA , you people need to lift up your levels, Try to come to terms of 15K bucks room .. It was not close to Rs.5000 per day . I stayed in The Khyber Kashmir for rs.15000 per day , and you should go stay there and see the customer friendly environment and sophistication they provide .. 15K bucks per day , you dont pay to firefight everyday ... A strict NO to all GRAND HYATT hotels all over from my side. I should have stayed in Taj. Thanks for ruining my vacation !!!",0
811,"The good: DINING. Meals at Chulha and The Verandah were world class. 

The bad: ROOMS. Very musty rooms, corridors and elevators. Rooms had mosquitoes and moths, and my ocean view balcony was littered with lizard dung on the walls, the floor, and the furniture that I did not even want to step out onto it.

The very bad: SERVICE. The teams across the property simply just did not seem ""motivated'. With the exception of two individuals during my three night stay, the culture on the property was one that lacked energy and an understanding of what was required to deliver outstanding let alone, basic hospitality. I have decided to forgo my litany of complaints here out of sheer exhaustion from disappointment. 

Will not return.",0
812,"I was here for three days with my colleagues and we have faced multiple issues. support and service orientation approach.

814,"First the pros, nice large number of rooms, a compact enough property for one to explore and enjoy every bit, quaint ruins in the midst of its nicely laid out lawns, really well made and picturesque interiors, a casino within the property and a popular, sumptuous Sunday brunch buffet. 

The staff was courteous for most, barring some from the room service team, but somehow it is shocking to see how they manage to make goof ups the way they did. I have to be fair and say the moment I pointed out the flaw or my unhappiness, there was immediate and prompt attention.

In our three nights stay, the following happened that warrant mention

(a) Dinner at Verandah, the Australian Grill Restaurant: I looked at the catch and chose a Red Snapper. The fish was to be charged based on weight, fair enough. Instead of seeking my consent once the fish was weighed, I was informed it would cost us US$ 85. I revolted and refused to accept the charges. I was politely told they assumed me to know the price of Red Snapper in Goa. It was only when I repeatedly refused that the staff agreed to charge me 40% of the quoted price. I also got a further 25% off on my final bill for being a Hyatt Gold Member.

(b) Room Service (night 2): The picture will explain it all. Food was served in a Stainless Steel Tiffin Carrier, with three sets of crockery/ cutlery but only one napkin, in a rundown dirty trolley. I was informed by the Room Service Crew, this time in a somewhat firm fashion that the style they follow for room service is 'picnic style' hence this was alright. Of course if an accompanying salad can be served properly, pre-plated why would the mains be in this shabby form is not something I got a convincing answer for. Upon protest, there was an immediate acknowledgment from the Executive Assistant Manager, goodies in the room and no charges for the meal.

(c) Extra bed in the room (night 3): Our booking was for two adults, two children with an extra bed in the room that we asked for upon check-in.

It worked alright for night one and two. The extra bed would be set at 8:00-8:30 PM and taken out the following morning. On the third night, we were informed all extra beds were taken hence we wouldn't get one. Argument given, since the bed was taken out in the morning, on our instructions they assumed we didn't need it. Of course that the same thing had been done for two nights on the trot and we had a booking for four in the room, didn't matter! We did get the bed after all.

I am not bothering to mention relatively minor infractions like a beer ordered at the poolside not being delivered, once again why won't you have a fully operational bar by the pool instead of getting your people to trek back and forth from the main building.

I'm attaching pictures, of some pretty sights in the property and of the picnic style dinner. I tried hard not to be severe, respecting the attention and honour given by many members of the staff, but for what I paid, the Hyatt brand, and a promise that was not delivered to, I felt I would be untrue not to write this out the way I have, full regard to the staff notwithstanding. 

It's not a place I will go back to for a family vacation.",0
815,"To make sure my check in into the hotel was smooth,I had called the reservation team to give my preferences(twin bed in one of the rooms) a week ago also requested for an early c/in, a day prior I get a call asking for my time of arrival 10 mins later another call for the same.On checking in none of the preferences taken care of.Ppl at the desk whisked it off by saying checkin time 3pm while I had arrived at 11pm. I was told room would take 1/2hr but instead to one hour for one of the rooms to be ready. I was even fine with this since I was excited to explore and enjoy the facilities but this excitement was short lived as my bags didn't arrive until I called up the desk 4times and went down all the way from guesthouse 6 to the bell desk only to find my bags still lying there. I wouldn't really mind carrying my own bags at least it could have saved me two hours worth of boredom,I was really annoyed as my plans for lunch and for recreation had already gone for a toss.When I finally landed in the pool I decided to grab a bite ,the spicy burger I had ordered didnt turn out to be spicy at all and to my surprise the ordertaker also asked me indirectly whether have i given a deposit at the time of check-in, when i had asked him to post it to my room as i was in the pool and couldn't carry any money. To make things worse In the evening when one of my friends decided to take a quick nap around 8 before we headed for dinner people from the desk call up to ask What time should they keep my bill ready?I had already informed the hotel on multiple occasions that I have a flight to catch next day. I was just wondering I should have stayed at the Taj at agouda, at least I would have got the feeling they wanted me to stay and not to vacate their room ASAP.Being from the same hospitality industry I have an eye for detail and I came to know that the rooms given to me didn't seem to be perfect (minibar locked and empty,no iron board in the other room etc.) Hotel is a very beautiful property, lacks Empathy,too much professionalism can disturb your guest.",0
816,"Right from the moment we checked in the staff was casual and careless about everything. Our luggage got misplaced and was found in another block after 2 hours, that too when we decided to take matters in our own hands. The staff is lethargic . Our food came after 1 hour and we ordered for additional indian breads it took another 45 mins. However the biggest incident happened on the last day when money was stolen from our bags. The hotel could not reach to any conclusion from their investigation and said the only solution is to file a police complaint. Our misplaced luggage made us more suspicious about the security of the hotel. Overall the property is built well but the staff is not trained to Hyatt standards. There is a huge difference in the experience at Park Hyatt and Grand. I would recommend park hyatt above it anyday. We had asked for a late checkout for 3 rooms and the hotel was empty on a monday but after initially agreeing to our request they insisted on checking out from a particular room which happened to be the room from where the theft had taken place. Also we had given the guarantee of 80 grands thru our card , they insisted we come to the lobby and settle the bill first and then go back to our rooms. Never seen this at any property across the world. Overall this hotel only flatters to deceive and i would say give it a miss. Goa has better options in terms of service",0
817,"This stay was rather forgettable for my family, specially my child. Now many of you might think that this is totally personal experience. However, I strongly believe that Hyatt Management is responsible for this incident and the experience. 

I visited this property on 26th May and planned to stay by 29th May. I was given Room #7006, I visited the place with my family including 5 yr old child. 
The room had a big round table with center support, with a very heavy glass top. My child was trying to get apples from the table and the table including the unattached glass fell on her, slicing her smallest toe in to two parts. This all happened within 10 mins of entering room. 
Me and my wife were shocked to see her crying in pain, and her toe sliced in to two parts. 

I contacted the reception for immediate assistance, however there was no doctor available. When i asked for hospital, I was told about Manipal Hospital being the nearest hospital (at 6 km distance). There was a nearby hospital GMC, just next to hyatt (1.5 km), which was not communicated to me and I came to know about it next day.

The implication was that my child lost her toe because of the delay in treatment. 

Next morning I wanted to checkout as my child had to go through another surgery. I wanted to return to Pune as soon as possible. 
When I went to reception, The staff told me that points can not be refunded, I told him the reason and without checking anything I was given an answer as no again.

I informed the reception that the this type of table and its glass must be removed from all the rooms so that any other child will not get hurt however I was given answer we can not as all rooms have same structure and design. BTW, the glass is so heavy that it can easily fracture leg of an adult.

I strongly feel Grand Hyatt, Goa as being negligent in considering customer safety and care.
Additionally, I was totally turned down by the negative response, the hotel staff or management was not courteous enough to ask for child's health, or to compensate for medical expenses or refund my reservation fee. 

Fortunately or unfortunately I could not take pics of that table as I wanted to leave that place as soon as possible. Otherwise I would have shared it on this forum. 

I shall never visit again or recommend this place to anyone.",0
818,Highly disappointed wid the place....exciting upon entering but as soon as we entered the series of shocks started...the rooms promised wer not given in fact ppl tried convincing us Tht v booked the given rooms only and on Tht they made us have a burden by saying Tht v got an upgrade....that's silly.... The food experience is worst...ordered in the room...the food Tht came was not sufficient .... Wat v ordered,0
819,"The food taste is very poor not as per a five star hotel, your office canteen will be better. When I check in the loo was not cleaned the pillow was stinking. The staff does not care about your bad experience, they don't even suggest a compensation.
Poor quality is the norm here. 
It should be a 1 star hotel.",0
820,"I write this review while I'm staying in the hotel. I loved the hotel so much that I was going to give it 5 rating.
However the frontdesk staff has done everything possible to spoil our trip. When I checked in, I told the receptionist- Aswati that I was staying for a company function for 2 days and then for a personal trip one day. She committed to me that I can continue the same room for all 3 days

From day 2 onwards we started getting requests to check out. I was getting tired of repeatedly saying that I'm here for three days.
On day 3, the receptionist Krishna insisted that we change rooms and we refused as the hotel had committed to us on day 1 that we will not need to change rooms.

Now this is where the harassment started. The reception manager- Adit Canteenwala showed no understanding of our request and kept insisting that we change rooms. When we refused, they decided to not provide any housekeeping services. We've waited till 3:30pm and the room remains uncleaned.

I called the reception, vipin picked up, I asked him to get me to talk to the manager and I called thrice and that guy refused to come on the line.

Thanks for the hospitality.",0
821,"It was the worst experience ever with pathetic service, it seemed like the staff here think that they are giving out free facilities at a shelter. They had a New Years Banquet which was absolutely the worst. More suitable as a cheap show at some cheap joint and definitely not in the class expected at a Hyatt. The Dinner on New Year's eve was another joke (On us!) with poor quality as well as choice.
The guys who clean the pathways create plumes of dust and yet don't bother to ensure that everything is tidy.
Only thing that worked OK was the WiFi!",0
822,Tortured by the music of a karoke party in the neighbouring room !! This was just the last straw in a string of poor quality service. We have been awake all night as the 'guest's of this other party' also rang the bell to our room 3 times ! Pity the staff !,0
823,"Been here for the past 3 days and its a family get together with infants with us. Right from the word go ,all we encountered were one hiccup to another . Right from making us wait for our check in ,unbelievable pathetic service in the restaurants both from the kitchen and the waiters. The only saving grace was the pool. The biggest shocker came minutes before I write the review now. Ordered room service for 5 of us. And surprise.... The food was delivered in a lunch box casserole... undercooked meat... Phew... Lets not even talk of the mosquitos menace, non responsive call desk and guest services,Dysfunctional service system etc etc... Last words to any traveller planning a Goan holiday. AVOID this property, imagine if this is the state of affairs at new year at Goa Grand hyatt. Then god save its residents from their service on a random day.",0
824,"We stayed in this property from 31 st December to 4 th January 2016,
Nice location but no service at all , if someone can live without room service , restaurant service and housekeeping then it's a good property to stay. 

Restaurant waiter forgot to serve the order , housekeeping forgot to serve ice , left used towels and pillow covers on room floor after cleaning ,room service took 1 hour to serve food. No personal touch or hospitality even for name sake. ",0
825,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt for 3 days to celebrate our 10th Anniversary. 

On our arrival at the bay view room, we found the room extremely dirty , bedsheets with blood stains , too many mosquitos and Blood marks on bathing robe too.

There was dust in the room all over. There was a layer of dust on the study table.I felt, we were given a shack in the name of a 5 star hotel. 

We made a complain about this to duty manager . She said , she will get it sorted in 30 min.

We had to wait for 90 min and kill our time after a long journey in the lobby area . It was quite painful to wait.

Anyway room was cleaned and they offered us a complimentary dinner for the next day in their restaurant .

After the dinner , I was asked to sign the cheque for which I said it was a complimentary dinner . The boys at the restaurant insisted that I sign for it as they had no message in their systems from the Duty Manager.

I had to follow up 3 times with the guest services to ensure that dinner is accounted for as complimentary. 




Next day and 2 days after that there were marriages booked in the hotel . Loudspeakers blaring Bollywood music which could be heard in the room was very annoying as it started from 6 Pm and ended very close to midnight. 

In front of our room,in the lawn chef's were preparing dinner for wedding guests .

I could not open the doors or pull the curtains of our room as you could see at least 50 people from hotel working /decorating and cooking dinner.

I think, it was one of the worst hotel experiences of my life . I have stayed in 5 star hotels for atleast last 15 years.
This was on of the most terrible experience.

I have made every effort not to photograph the staff preparing dinner in front of my room for 2 days.

I would never ever stay at Grand Hyatt even if they offer accomadation free of charge.",0
826,"It takes a lot of pain to write a review within 15 hours of arriving at a hotel

The service quality is just appalling 

Reached the hotel at 2 15 and they were not ready with rooms. This was disappointing as they knew when we would be reaching before hand and we have 2 infants

After the usual expression of disappointment, suddenly one room is ready! 

Anyways we move to have lunch and after a wait for ten minutes, we were told that a la Carte might be restricted in serving. The stewards seem to be completely unaware of the infants and the fact that they r tired. 
Again, it takes stern talk to get what we need

The rooms are good but some equipment and silver like bar glasses and coffee machine still have signatures of the previous occupants

The most bewildering part is ROOM SERVICE. I have never ever been to a hotel where you take at least ten attempts to get to room service! And when I asked them, why is this. He said it is like that only as they have only guy to pick up the phone. WHAT!!!!!!

Finally we come to Bfast. We walk in, no one to serve water or ask for tea/coffee. Spread is disappointing and no service again

Just 2 days to go before we end this

Never ever come here again",0
827,"Honestly, i wish I would have never shortlisted this hotel. 
From the garden facing room - which actually a generator facing room.

To restaurant which is actually a complete no-no to vegetarians. They do charge a full price for buffet but have only 3-4 options.
Add on to that, you are the last person to be cater since you might not get the tips from the indians guests.

Not to forget staff standing at the beach and pool side. They too have the same tendency to cater to the foreign guests as compared to Indian guests - obvious reasons tips.
There was no person at the beach side to help with towels and shades.

Above all, the services are too slow and lot many times the people involved do not respond.

Its been almost over an hour when I requested to speak to someone senior to express my concern and no one has contacted yet. Shows the importance of the customer.

It was not a good option. I Have stayed at Marriott and Taj Village earlier in Goa and would prefer them over Grand Hyatt or say rather not to go.

-Kunal",0
828,"The connectivity to this hotel is not good. They charge more for transport than market rate. Airport transfers is complementary but if you want train station transfer it is chargeable. No reason was provided for this unfair treatment. The food is boring as same menu is repeated everyday. Service of food is so slow that you can't finish your food in less than 2 hours. So, if you are taking 3 time food your 6 hours a day are used in taking food only. The beach is peaceful. No waves in the sea. One advice - Bring one mosquito killing racquet with you as you will have to face mosquito menace here.",0
829,"I am really upset as this was unexpected when we checked in .. specially when some one spends more than 55k for a 3 day stay i am writing this while we are still in the hotel ..We checked in on 30th November evening at around 6:00 pm and we are scheduled to check out tomorrow 3rd December.

Firstly , we had requested for an hour late check out on the day of our arrival as our flight is during the 2nd half .. we have an all meal package. We were told to check the tsame the next day.. We contacted them however were again told to check the status on 2nd December. .We spoke to someone at the reception today i.e. 2nd Dec and he agreed for a 1pm check out instead of 12 noon. .but today evening we got a call asking us to check out by 12 noon as the hotel is booked for a wedding starting tomorrow..

Secondly, Our's is an all meal package . .but today 2nd December when we went for dinner there was a sea food fest going on so the usual restaurant The dinning room was closed for dinner and we were asked to go to another restaurant called chulha..when we walked we were offered Indian buffet ..where supposedly a private family event had been organised ..We started our meal ..The spread was just about OK ..not as per the expectations. .While we we were eating we were also facing lot of stares from the family as if we were the unexpected guests eating their food some of them were even talking about us ..We could easily make out by their gestures that their understanding was it's their buffet. .We felt very humilated ..The worst part was that since it was a huge group they were making it uncomfortable for us ..A young boy in his twenties with beard was touching the food with his hands. .smelling it .. it was disgusting and very unhygienic .. We couldn't finish our meal and had to leave ..We spoke to the restaurant manager Swati and told her ..how they were behaving ..she apologised but by now. .I am already upset and disgusted. .as this is not what you expect from a 5star..Not coming here again for sure. .neither will I recommend it to anyone..",0
830,"Unfriendly staff , horrible processes and callous attitude . Worst experience for a long long time. Entire hotel staff has a very careless attitude. They just want to get rid of you as soon as possible without even trying to understand your problem.

831,"Stayed for 3 days back in August. Wouldnt complain abut property.. well maintained but overall experience has been the worst i have ever experienced.

At the time of check in - Provided front desk staff with CC for pre authorization. $ 270 debited from account. During check out, realised dicing charges added which belonged to some other room No. took the front desk staff more than hour to rectify the error.

Finally i was told the remaining balance will be credited back in my card.

When i finally arrived back to my country from holiday, realized the front desk staff has debited the card in error and i was charged once again.

Its been over 2 months & No. of emails exchange with their finance team and senior manager but all you get told is its been investigated.. not they have stopped replying.

My bank has initiated the process at their end to recover the transaction which will take few weeks..

all i can request is, be careful when you hand over your CC to staff and check transaction details..

@hyatt.bambolim, shame on you, i wish i could write something positive but you left me with no choice..",0
832,"Its really very worst experience for stay in this hotel for one night. What we have paid is all waste of money. The rooms which we have requested and paid such a big amount for one night is totally waste of money. 

Requested hyatt bambolim to please the money you are wasting in decorations in evening, just spen the money on good breakfast and others 

This hotel is not recommended to anyone who is coming for enjoying.",0
833,"The hotel and grounds are nice, as are the staff that work in the restaurants, pool areas and housekeeping.

The location is somewhat out of the way in the middle of nowhere, and the hotel doesn't have a beach.

The management team at the hotel are terrible. When issues arise they simply don't know where to start, they chat endless babble at you, which just wastes your time.

Similar to other reviews we'd also warn you to watch out for their billing! Our credit card details were compromised following the card going out of our sight for the pre-authorisation, and thousands of  / $ were later spent. The management didn't understand the issue at all. Terrible experience.

There are so many other lovely hotels in Goa , I'd highly recommend you pick one of them eg Leela.

I won't be staying with Hyatt for a long time!",0

835,This hotel is not at all sensitive to customers need. They had stray dogs outside our room and whe complained they were very casual about it.even after showing them photographs they sent a simple apology. Would not visit again.,0
836,"You are most unwelcome at this wonderfully kept sprawling property called the Grand Hyatt, Goa. 
Except for the staff at their fine dining Indian restaurant, Chulha and the bell boys who were driving the golf cars to help you commute, none of the staff gave you the feeling that you were indeed welcome at the Grand Hyatt, Goa.
I have been a hard-core Taj loyalist all my life. Having been pampered and spoiled, being a Taj Inner Circle member, by the Taj Group and the Oberois, being an Oberoi Advantage programme member, one felt disappointed by the cold and unwelcome behaviour by the staff at the Grand Hyatt, Goa.
Starting with the boy holding a placard at the Airport who was too busy looking for other guests once you had spotted him. He would keep you waiting unattended while you waited for your vehicle to come by. The driver was courteous but was a stiff upper lip kind of a character.
You reach the Hotel and you are taken to the lobby by another courteous boy. You wait there while a girl from the front desk, Tanaya, arrives with a card swipe machine. Because we were booked through a travel agency on an American (all meals included) plan, she kept insisting that we would have to deposit Rs15000.00 towards incidental charges @ Rs.5000.00 per day. That was rudely surprising! A sort of prepaid account wherein amount for all additional usage and consumption, if any, would be charged and you would be returned the balance cash. Never before have I seen such a policy. Not even at the Taj Exotica where we stayed when we visited Goad four years ago. Probably, these people have had some unpleasant experiences of people booked through a travel agency not carrying enough cash. We had no choice. Tanaya would not relent. Meanwhile, we were served some cranberry juice in bottleneck glasses as a welcome drink with wet towels.
We proceeded for lunch in the multi-cuisine restaurant, the Dining Room, serving buffet. It was stuffy inside. The airconditioning for three days, we observed, was insufficient. It was filled with smell of sea-food and to our utter dismay, the chef at the live grill counter grilled vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes on the same stove using the same fork to lift the two varieties of food. As a strict vegetarian, I was aghast. This too was a never-before experience. They need to work on the logistics of the spread because if you want to serve yourself salad, which generally is the first helping one would take, you will have to walk almost to the other diagonal corner to get hold of the plates. Lack of planning.
The bhul-bhulaiyya that the Hotel is, one needs to make some effort to reach your room. We had booked a bay-view room. 2212 was allotted. We searched for the same. Our baggage had been taken care of. The view was excellent. The room was nice and cosy. House-keeping department makes effort here. It was evident. But the recliners in the balcony were in a real bad shape with canes broken and the angles that could not be adjusted.
Inside, the TV is mounted at an awkward angle and one would have a stiff neck if one intended to watch a T-2o match. 
Then came another architectural fault to the fore. As I wanted to lie in the bath tub in the neatly appointed bathroom, my wife who was enjoying her afternoon siesta, woke up with the noise of flowing water that echoed from within the bathroom. The same was the case with with bathroom water too. The noise would not let the other person sleep. The toiletries were nice and sufficient.
The rudest shock came in when we approached 'Chulha' the speciality Indian restaurant. Surprisingly, they have a SET MENU (the same for lunch and dinner!) for guests booked on the AP. Another never-before experience. It had no welcome drink and no soup to offer. The assistant restaurant manager on duty (name forgotten) was curt and unaccommodating. So much so that he was reluctant to serve us Paratha stating that it was not on offer. I had to literally haggle to get him serve us parathas which he did as if he was offering us something out of the way. I showed my displeasure.
The next morning breakfast was again in the Dining Room. That stuffy feel and smell!! Nothing much to offer for vegetarians like us. The dosas were not crispy. The taste was not universal accompanied with sambhar that was so thick that it could be chewed. Almost the same menu got repeated on day three as well. Shows how casual the whole team is.
The lunch at 'Chulha' was the only option. We wanted to share our previous evening's experience with the restaurant Manager and we called for him but instead, he sent in Naval, the Deputy! And he came across as a wonderful young local boy who along with the smiling executive chef Vicky and the server Rajmani and the others made us feel too good with the warmth they exuded. Full marks for the wonderful bunch who henceforth made sure that we had pleasant memories of our dining for the remaining part of our itinerary.
Because a school-time friend, now a real estate agent in Goa, of mine had invited us for the traditional Goa shack dinner, we thought of making a request to the front desk if in lieu of the dinner we would miss, if we could be given something else. None at the front desk had any clue about it. In comes, Ranzia, who seemed to be in some position of authority. She very curtly said, she would let us know. We came back to the room and it was not until in the evening and after two reminders that Ranzia told us we could join in for cocktails and snacks in the club lounge on the following day. We being teetotalers weren't too keen on the cocktail part. The following day, I called up the reception to check for the timings. Ranzia wasn't around but some one with the name Sid... (Half forgotten) said we could go there between 6 and 8 in the evening. In the club, there was no intimation and we were embarrassed by the bearer telling us that we weren't supposed to be there. I asked him to check back with Ranzia. He did and did not tell us that we were indeed welcome. I had to walk up to him to ask again if he had spoken to Ranzia. Lack of communication. 
The free wi-fi was weak and hardly worked. After complaining about it on the last day of our stay, a help came in after almost 45 minutes. We were asleep when our door was banged. When we did not respond, a call (!) came in from the house-keeping department that their man was waiting for us to open the door so that wi-fi could be fixed. He came. He struggled. He installed a booster and yet the wi-fi did not work. He said he was sorry.
The lady attendant at the spa was as stone-faced as a primary teacher would be! Looking at her attitude, we decided not to use the spa.
On the morning we were to check-out, a loud bang on the door pulled me out of my meditation. There was this boy who wanted to check the mini bar. As a matter of policy, we don't even touch the mini bar. Barely fifteen minutes had passed and there was another bang at the door. There was another person who had come to check the mini bar. Finally, I lost my head and protested. No communication!
Since we had a flight to catch at around 2, we had at the time of check-in had requested to depart by 1215 hours. I called up the reception around 11.30 am and requested for a bell boy to fetch my baggage. Despite reminders, for close to almost 30 minutes, no one emerged. I had to go to the front desk and talk some serious business. It was now that some movement started. The boy at the reception did not give me a feedback form as none could be found in the room. He said I would receive a mail for the feedback. Till date, I am yet to receive one. No smiles at the check-out either.
My first interface with the Hyatt would be my last one with them. With such an indifferent treatment, who would want to spend a fortune to feel unwelcome at every step and with practically, everyone you encountered..",0
837,"We spent 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt in August. The property itself is quite big - 28 acres of lawns, huge pool, restaurants, big spa, etc - what you would expect in a Grand Hyatt. However what you do not expect at the Hyatt is the dismal response and care of the management. The day before we were leaving, I went for a massage at the spa. The massage was great, it was peaceful since it was practically empty - this was low season. The problem began after the massage - my footwear could not be found. That was quite odd, but the therapist said hey would send it to our room shortly. And that was the last I heard from the therapist or from the Spa. I informed the reception, the management, house keeping - everyone, but got NO response.

The next morning we went down to the reception and the spa ourselves but just got blank looks and no responses besides ""we are looking into it"". I was even asked if i was sure I was wearing my footwear when I reached the spa!!! The entire last morning was wasted in trying to get a response form the spa. Then we were told that the cameras in the spa had a glitch and they could not review anything, so could not comment on the matter. Considering that i was practically the only guest at the spa, why they could not figure this out is amazing. The therapist conveniently was not present the next day

The fact that my footwear is unavailable in India and thus irreplaceable for now had no effect on the hotel, no remorse, no attempt to make up for the theft. On our objections they reluctantly waived the massage charge, which would have been a common courtesy in any decent hotel.

It is only after we came home and I sent an email, that i got the first response from the head of security, saying that they had retrieved the camera footage and were glad to confirm that i was wearing the said footwear when i entered the spa! Unbelievable!! 

But it didnt stop there. 2 days later they wrote saying they had found the Fitflops ""under highly suspicious circumstances"" and were sending them to me. 2 days later i get a package - and its an old, thoroughly used oversized pair of someone else's Fitflops!! Which hapless guests footwear they took away this time, under which ""suspicious circumstances"" I have no idea but I immediately told them this, and their response was, oh, we are so sorry - if its okay can we come and collect them from you, then?

Unbelievable!!! Promptly showed up to collect them- no lack of efficient response then!! - and have left the matter at that.

Its not the footwear or the problem in replacing them that is the issue- its the sheer carelessness with which this was dealt with . It is NOT what you expect of a luxury hotel. Have stayed in hotels all over the world, have never posted such a negative review, but this place was shocking. 

Oh, and if you are going there for the beach, dont bother either - its a beachfront hotel but with no beach to really speak of - just a slimy strip of black dirty sand that you would not want to step foot on - with or without your footwear!!",0
838,"check in procedure takes too long staff didn't bother to respond or solve complaints (bad/ no WIFI in room, Spa appointment canceled without notification). I had left in a note covering the above issues addressed to the management at the reception at my second day of stay. never received a responds from anyone neither were the issues solved!",0
839,"The Hotel really needs to learn Hopitality. Day 1 at the Club Lounge denied Hot Tea or Coffee by a Guy named Suvir at the Lounge, reason its 6 to8 happy hours we only serve cold beverages. Later that night 2 boys 3 yrs and 4 yrs approx got locked out of their rooms at 2am at night. In Block 7 the Club block there were no guards or security from the hotel. We had to intervene and call the house keeping security which took another hour so we had a sleepless night. 
Following days we just recieved service denials from the staff at the lounge so much so that a request for Aloo parantha for breakfast for my daughter 6 years was turned down by the Lounge Manager Keith (Reason- it will get cold and we are too busy to get from the main Building) Come on... Keith 
Overall service was the worst i have ever seen in a Grand Hyatt Property.
Rooms- No inroom amenity such as Tea Coffee in the room. Had to order the house keeping to place some. When he placed later during the day just 1 sachet of Coffee. 
The room so called POOL VIEW had another amazing balcony but sorry you cant use it as there is a water logging problem. The rains can actually flood your room as well so please dont choose these rooms. If you wanna sit in your balcony call the House keeping wait fr him atleast 45 mins to an hr, and get it cleaned then probably u can use till it rains again. 
Overall my holiday was totally not worth it infact the entire experienced ruined it.
The only guy who heard us out was FRONT OFFICE MANAGER Mr. Adil Canteenwalla. Sweet and courteous. Just on his words kept staying and tolerating the nonsense.",0
840,"I was booked in by my travel agent into this property based on the reviews here. I had booked a Grand Club Room with a view. They confirmed that the room with the view would be given to me upon availability. I book 2 weeks in advance and they can't confirm that I would be getting a room with a view?

I checked in at 3:55 PM and I am told that to get a room with a sea view or a pool view, I would have to pay extra. The email that their Sales person, Nazneen Qureshi sent me had NO mention of paying anything extra.

After agreeing to pay the extra (the alternative would have been to cancel the booking and be charged for the stay and then look for another hotel) I was escorted up to my room by a man who had no idea how the switches worked or which one turned on which light. This was at 3:55 PM

I kept ringing the reception for my luggage which FINALLY arrived at 5:15 PM. The excuse offered was that the rains had held up baggage delivery. This is Goa in the Monsoons. Weren't they expecting rain????

I was given Room 7201 which was a pool view room. The room was dirty and the verandah had a stain that had not been cleaned since who knows when. When I asked housekeeping to clean it, a man came and wiped the floor down and said that the stain would not go.

According to my booking, I was supposed to get in-room WIFI. The signal is there but it is so weak that nothing connects and you spend hours just waiting for pages to load. They, after many complaints, put a signal booster in the room which did not seem to help much.

The next day, I went down to the Club Lounge for breakfast. The selection there is very limited. However, I had what was available. That night, I got an upset stomach that was so bad that I had to get my friend to take me to a doctor....

I had lunch at their coffee shop that day. They charged me for bottled water when I had specifically asked for regular house water. In any case, I was feeling too ill to actually do much so I went back to my room and retired.

Then they shifted me to a ""Sea View"" room. The seals of the door separating the room from the verandah were damaged and through out the stay, there was a horrible howling noise. I didn't complain again as I had had enough of fighting with the hotel and waited for the trip to finally get over so that I could go back home.

This is one hotel that I would request you people to avoid.",0
841,"We just stayed in here for 4 days in pool facing rooms. 
First of all this is not on BEACH.. its on BAY which stops your view by another piece of land and you dont see horizon on beach the way you otherwise would.
The view is blocked and hence you dont see too far.
Service wise i have never seen any staff so thoroughly confused. Because of design conference happening they fumbled upon whom to send where and the food was absolutely ordinary.",0
842,"We stayed in the club rooms at the Grand Hyatt Goa and had booked the Ocean view rooms. When we arrived at the hotel, They did not give us the Ocean view rooms and after haggling with them we did get the ocean view rooms but without a ocean view as the rooms were on the ground floor and there was the church ruins right in front of our room. So my suggestion would be not to book an ocean view room as it actually is not ocean view its only ocean facing with things like trees and ruins blocking the actual view. 

Apart from that The Grand Hyatt is one of the best hotels to stay in Goa for the location and the Service and Hospitality.",0
843,I stayed there for two days and two nights as i have made my room booking including breakfast for which i have already paid money in advance but the hotel staff said breakfast is not included in your package i also had a conformation mail from the hotel such a buggling .at that trip i also stayed at leela for 3 days ut was far better with such nice staff at almost same rates.,0
844,"Visited this place in June 2015 with great expectations with my wife and one year old toddler and two more family friends and their kids. Its a grand and luxurious place. 
Accommodation and comfort excellent. Location isn't that good, no easy access to beach. Not a clean beach, very muddy and brown. This place is not child safe. No baby changing facilities at all. Few under trained staff may annoy you due to their attitude. As a vegetarian, I would recommend to go to Chulha restaurant (inside hyatt itself) which is one of finest restaurant in Goa and best food i ever had, especially resto staff are very welcoming, suggest you as per your choice of taste buds, don't forget to get Indian authentic desserts (esp. jalebi). 100% recommend to visit resto but stay some other place.",0
845,"Stayed in Grand Hyatt, Goa for 2 nights for a conference.It is located 25 kms from Dabolim airport & takes 40 mins to reach by cab. Hotel coaches pick u up on prior request. On entering hotel reception the dissappointment sets in. It is lack lustre, the staff dont have a smile & they ask whether u wont mind carrying your luggage to ur room. When asked where rooms are located they just point a fingur in air. The hotel is supposed to be inspired by a 17th century indo-portuguese palace, there is a lot of concrete structure wherever u look around. There are blocks where rooms are located , like in hostels. The rooms are luxurious but badly designed. The TV is located in an odd position. U have to struggle to open the wardrobes, the kettle is hidden in a cupboard & u may actually miss it unless u look for it. The central air-conditioning is not good. The bathrooms are too open for comfort & showers are atrocious. The soap covers are difficult to open in wet hands- why cant they be consumer friendly ? The housekeeping took an hour to come after a request. No staff are trained to greet you in the corridors. The views from balcony are only a few trees & buildings.
The breakfast was laid out in un usual way to make guest miss half the items. Lunch is ordinary. 
High tide, so could see sea from a distance only.
Overall dissappointing. U can get better hotels closer to Panjim for these rates. Free WIFI never connected , so had to switch back to 3G. Will not recommend this one to anybody.",0
846,"Have stayed at many resorts in Goa.. But grand Hyatt is one of the most average properties not worth the money paid for.. There is no beach during monsoon.. Unmaintained gardens, dirty walkway, its more of a business hotels for conference.. The first resort in Goa which doesn't make you feel the bliss of being in Goa !! 
Wrt services , there are no activities for kids, swimming pool is just ok.. All the activities mentioned on their site is not available .

Just 2 weeks back, I stayed in taj exocita which was a complete contrast to this hotel. Excellent service , excellent property, clean , even while it was raining it was beautiful and truly made you feel like a paradise. Clean, beautiful , rooms were bigger in size , cycles were available , excellent spa, archery , table tennis.. A wow experience !!

So next time time you r in Goa...say a NO to grand Hyatt and a definite yes to taj exocita.!!",0
847,service was not to mark very bad expereince during stay.they made my stay restless and uncomfortable .and they only mean to sale the package and club membership with wrong information all the managers started .,0
848,"Had been on a family holiday to this hotel. check in was average staff was busy only in paperwork. The rooms were well kept neat and clean. But the most worst experience with this hotel was their customer care at hotel and buggy service. On the day of check in , that evening we had called for buggy clearly stating that my wife had sprained her leg and that she cannot walk easily. we planned to go to the beach place and enjoy the sunset. we had to wait for 40 minutes and 6 calls to get a buggy. the buggy arrived a 7.30 PM after i had raise my voice to get a buggy for my wife. 
When the buggy tha person blamed us that we had not informed properly that why he was late. After that incidence we never called a buggy during our 2 days stay . my wife to walk all th way to hotel from guest house 6 for dinner and lunch with all the pain. 

I have decided not to recommend this hotel to anyone and i may not visit again to this hotel. very worst service. stay away from this hotel",0
849,"First our rooms were incorrect. The wrong configurations and even still one wasn't ready. Then they sent someone to tell us our second room was ready, gave us the key, and it was a bum key to nowhere. We were stranded in the hallway. Every phone conversation was just more confusion and more excuses. By the way, the lobby is unbearable. Much too hot. 

We finally get our room and head to the pool. Rather than letting us enjoy ourselves they decided to harass us about a cotton shirt in the pool. We told them to bugger off and they sent continuingly escalated levels of management...must have been a slow day. It was comical. Every person gave us a different and less logical reason. We eventually went to the hotel manager and he told them to leave us alone, like they should of from the beginning. 

Then there was the iron incident. They had a broken iron in our room - something the maid should have caught since it was missing a prong! It took 4 hours and 4 phone calls. We wore wrinkled clothes to dinner. The first call brought a carpenter. The second call resulted in them taking our iron and leaving nothing. The third call got us an ice bucket. And the final call brought an iron. We didn't dare test it out because it would be too disappointing to end up right back where we started. 

On a bright note the pool was great, once we were allowed to enjoy it, and the food was rather good.",0
850,Asked for a early check in at the time of reservation. Was refused when arrived. No courtesy. Was sitting in dining area having breakfast and waiting for them to give room at regular check in time. After a while very politely and indirectly was asked to move from there if I was done. Basically no place even for guests with confirmed reservation to sit in such a grand(?) hotel property. This is probably first time any hotel has refused to give early check in.,0
851,"Staying at the Grand Hyatt, one has certain expectations on the general standard of the hotel and its service level. Too many things to point out. It turned out to be an expensive stay, which basically compares to a standard Thomas Cook all-in holiday but twice as expensive.",0
852,"I had read some pretty unfavourable reviews of this hotel, which was a surprise given its a Grand Hyatt and having stayed there for 2 nights I can understand the bad reviews. I doubt this hotel would pass a Hyatt secret audit!

The actual room, facilities and layout are nice and well maintained. The spa is excellent as was the service in the spa. Unfortunately that's where the positives stop.

Pretty much any interaction with the food and beverage area was poor! The service at the pool area is very slow, the waiters aren't looking for customers they happily walk past people asking for menus and the like you can wait 20 minutes for service and each time we ordered something there was a mistake or something wasn't available.

The meal at the ""Australian"" restaurant was a complete rip off. The food was covered in chilli and had no resemblance to any meal I have had in Australia! 

The buffet restaurant was a Spanish restaurant for the night and the food was poor, more like the standard you get at an all inclusive hotel not a Grand Hyatt and yet again chilli in everything. The food and beverage outlets here need a real look at!!!

The Internet was non existent!!!! 2016 Hyatt you should be providing a decent internet connection. We used our phones instead!!!

Anyway I would struggle to recommend this hotel really. The staff are all disjointed and don't work as a team.

The hotel doesn't have its own drivers so the pick up from the hotel was with a driver who drove horribly! Again these people represent your brand and if you arrive stressed it doesn't helps

It's not often I say this but I was happy to leave.",0
853,I would never stay at this hotel again. To name a few issues... 1) The concierge did not respond to emails I sent in advance of our stay. 2) Our room looked out over a lawn where loud events were held every day (and at every time of day). 3) No service at all in the pool area. 4) Food was cold - often inedible. 5) House keeping staff didn't clean the room in a timely manner. This hotel is too expensive to put up with this shoddy service and poor quality.,0
854,"Stayed at Grand Hyatt on my wedding night. The experience was quite ordinary for the price of Rs. 15000 a night. Here are some of things we found lacking

1. On arrival at the hotel after our wedding ceremony at 1 in the morning, we were made to wait at the hotel lobby so that I could get identification documents for my wife. The fact that even my wife needed an ID proof was never asked for in advance. We finally were able to get a picture of photo ID after calling our relatives.

2. We were charged Swach Bharat cess, even though the booking was paid for before the cess came into effect. Why should I have had to pay a cess for a payment that I did before the cess came into effect

3. There was nothing special waiting for us in the room that cost us Rs. 15,000 a night . No rose petals on the bed, or a warm bath even though it was mentioned during booking that it was booked for a wedding couple. It was just a plain old hotel room, with nothing to make you feel that the hotel went the extra mile to make your stay special. 

4. There was no breakfast included in the price, even though you pay such a high price for a basic hotel room.

5. Only on day 2 of our stay did it appear that the room service created some bed deco (Towel doves with rose petals) while we we were in the room.

I regret to having spent my wedding night at this hotel, it was one of the worst experiences I could have for the price I paid. I for one will never stay at Grand Hyatt ever again.",0
855,"We just checked into Grand Hyatt Goa, as our annual vacation for 4N/5D Family Package and what a disappointing experience awaited us. We were subjected to wait for 45 minutes before room allotment. Am being accompanied by my infant child and my elderly 72 yr old mother and wife. We were never offered even water on arrival and only after requesting for some we were provided much later by the staff Sonia who was assisting us with our check in and she finally arranged for some beverage. 

Despite an email confirmation from the hotel reservation desk 2 days back for reserving lunch for us due to our late checking since our flight from Delhi arrived at 14:50hrs and we reached the hotel exactly at 16:00 hrs, we were refused the same stating the buffet was available only until 3:45 pm. We stated that the delay was due to their airport transfer making us wait for 15 mins at the airport. We requested for a meal in exchange for the lunch on the day of check out which we planned not to avail due to flight timings, however that was refused either. 

On mentioning that being Platinum member and that if they could offer me some discount on the meal was turned down as well. Further request to access Club Lounge was also refused stating it was sold out. 

We were confirmed in our reservation a bay view twin however the room alotted had only one king bed. The room was allotted however when checked with guest services appeared to be still on someone else's name and despite identifying myself with the executive he still couldn't trace the me in the system. 

Finally I had to escalate this to the duty manager Mr. Gaurav and after his intervention another room was provided as an option with twin beds but at a higher floor which was not suitable for my mother who not only being a senior citizen but also a cancer patient and for her that would have been inconvinient. 

Also I had requested a ground floor room while during the reservation. We were assured of a room change the next day. Also Mr. Gaurav called me up later to inform that we were finally allowed club access for today and that turned out to be after 2.5 hours after we had arrived tired and hungry. 

Dinner at the ""Chulha"" restaurant was the most disappointing experience. There was no one to inform us upon check in that the regular dining restaurant  Dining Hall serving buffet as a part of our package wasn't operating tonight and there was another restaurant - The Chulha offering fixed menu meals. 

We had to explore on our own and eventually asking a few staff members reached there around 9:00 pm. However we were asked to come back again roughly after an hour stating non-availability of seating. The assistant F&B Director Mr. Saumyadeep offered his best courtesy and also assisted us to return back to our room and that he would let us know once the table is available or alternatively served at another table in the Dining Hall which was closed. 

We were again asked to come over with a confirmed availability and we arrived back at 10:30 pm. He ensured the Chef prepare something to our taste. Despite his instructions, the service was pathetically slow and were not provided attention by the staff until about 20 mins when we had to request them to serve starters. Chef Vicky was kind enough to provide us an option for food although there was only one round of starters whereas we were made to understand this as to being unlimited orders. 

The main course arrived after a lot of time and after requesting several staff members. The serving portions were very small and we had to request for more. In the second serving the chicken dish was not properly cooked and so were the prawns and as a result we had to discard the same. 

We had to request several times to refill our water glasses as no one did that on their own. On requesting to hurry up as it was almost 11:30 p.m, one of the staff members Mr. Sumit stated this and I quote "" We are too busy and too means we are really really busy"". 

The dessert was offered as only one portion of Jalebi dish to be shared by 3 of so and us was the Rasmalai dish being just one bowl. The server Ms/ Swati actually assumed and she stated too and I quote  you will want to share this hence I will get you another plate. On telling her we are 3 of us and hence expect 3 portions she expressed her inability to have understood that we actually needed 3 separate portions and sarcastically smiled and went away. 

Guess that was the last straw and our dinner was ruined completely on the first day of our 4 nights vacation here in Goa in this hotel. Right from the time we arrived we are experiencing really the lowest standards of hospitality. Being a Platinum member and soon to be Diamond and after having stayed in several Hyatt properties both in India and overseas and several times this year the recent being a week back in HongKong, this is the most unimaginable experience. We are spending a lot of money for these 4 nights and feel cheated and greatly disappointed. Planning to check out tomorrow and save the rest of our vacation.",0
856,"I stayed recently from10-12-2015 to 13-12-2015 attending a conference. The service is poor. The baggage took more then 30 mins to arrive. The room lighting was bad. The bathroom was horribly designed with drainage hole being in the opposite end of the slope of floor. so, the bathroom stayed flooded. the service iof waiters in breakfast place was rude. We were thrwn out of the bar because some rich guy came over and took over the place",0
857,"Non functional A/C in the room, poor room design and cleaning, staff non motivated and poorly trained. Food is very average. Excessively geared towards a western tourist palate. But even foreigners should get a near real taste of food ! Surprising for a Hyatt property. Midway through the stay feel like moving out but another 24 hours to eat. Not staying here again for sure. 
Property design, sailing club and lush greens the only positive.",0
858,"We always stay at the Aldeia De Goa complex across the road, residents having access to the Hyatt facilities, also enjoying various discounts. This process has always worked well in previous years, resulting in us spending considerable thousands of Rupees at the hotel. This year was no exception until the last day of our 3 week holiday when they refused the discount as we did not have the landlord's discount card with us. We will continue to use the facilities where no costs are incurred in line with the agreements but spend no money!! The prices are extortionate, and without the discounts are considerably more than other 5 star establishments in the area. 
Staff are courteous and Internet ok but not the fastest.
Beach is poor compared to hotels further South.
Much better options available elsewhere in Goa.",0
859,below what you would expect than a Hyatt resort. Pool is nice. beach not so much. rooms are ok - no more. Bathroom is nuce. My main concern is that I cought them twice cheating me. once in the Bar - they actuallt lied and tried to overcharge. the second time was with the car when they tried to take more than ehat was agreed - told me I took the car earlier thaan I did and more. looks like to staff was briefed to try and take as much as they can..service was below the expected standard as well,0
860,"We were a family of 4 - a couple with 2 kids aged 11 and 7 years. We booked Grand Hyatt, Bambolim for 2 nights on the 2nd October long weekend. We had taken a Club room with 2 extra beds for the children and 'all meals included' package.

We drove down from Pune and were super excited regarding our stay at this luxury hotel.

It's an amazing property! All our room requests were met inspite on 100% occupancy! Great job here!

Super comfortable room, with extra beds put in each night n removed during the day as per our request! Housekeeping and Front Desk were good!

We enjoyed the Grand Club lounge with its nibbles n drinks! It was a great lounge, close to our room, to just send the kids with their tablets to chill :-) Wonderful!

Awesome property, well maintained! We enjoyed their private beach even in pouring rain! Amazing experience!

Why I've given 2 stars for this review is the food which was a huge let down. We are foodies and vegetarians. But the buffet at The Dining Room was tasteless to say the least! We thought it would be better at the next meal, but no :-(
The chef tried to serve as per the kids requests, but still we were not satisfied with the taste. Absolutely no flavor! Salt so low, it was almost bland....

The ventilation of this restaurant also needs to be looked into. It made the vegetarians giddy, even after we tried sitting as far away from the buffet as possible!

We had one meal at their other restaurant 'Chulah'.... Superb, lip-smacking and very satisfying!! 

Inspite of making our displeasure obvious to the chefs, they turned down our last request of packing a few vegetable sandwiches for our 9 hours drive back to Pune! Well well, we've stayed at The Leela, Goa and at Vivanta, Coorg recently. I suggest Hyatt learns something from these chains where customer is the king.

Food is a major highlight of our holidays. I feel sorry to say that we won't be returning to Grand Hyatt, Bambolim and may shy away from other Hyatt hotels as well after eating such pathetic food which spoiled our holiday!",0
861,"The Good: beautiful hotel and grounds, friendly staff and very close to the beach. 

The Bad: Poor staff, musty rooms (humidity seems to be an issue) and potentially unsafe food.

Some details:
Myself and my fiance arrived for a 7 day holiday, the check-in experience was excellent but unfortunately it started to go downhill from there. After check-in we were given the tour of the grounds and we stopped off at the club lounge as I had opted for the upgraded package, I unfortunately decided to eat a grape in the club lounge. That evening I knew something had gone wrong and I ended up being food poisoned and just generally unwell for most of the week. The following day I contacted the hotel and asked them to arrange a doctor visit as I was very ill. I had a phone conversation with a doctor and got some medicine which the hotel got for me or so I thought, on checkout I had been charged for both calls to the doctor and the medicine, would have been a nice touch if the hotel had paid the 320 rupees! 

So my fiance went for breakfast and she was approached 3 times by separate people, sometimes 2 or 3 people to ask her room number. In the end she had to sign and have it charged to the room. One would think the staff of a 5* hotel would have the ability to make a call to reception to see if a guest should actually be on the breakfast list but unfortunately this wasn't the case, I had to ring later that day and have it addressed.

Two days later we were returning that evening from a lovely meal in Chulha (I was improving and tried some food) and we found our room door left fully open, not just slightly open, fully open. The turndown service had forgotten to close our door! When I complained and the supervisor came to my room to apologise I asked a fairly standard question, can you guarantee this won't happen again, to which I got an unexpected reply: ""I'll try"". Needless to say I wasn't too impressed with the response. Luckily I had absolutely everything jammed into the safe as I was aware of the housekeeping pitfalls from a previous stay where all of my bags were searched and a friend had 130 stolen from his suitcase.

So we decided to give the Sunday brunch a go and it was fantastic, amazing collection of food and drinks and the service was excellent. The only problem was at checkout when we realised that it's an extra 1k rupees per person if you take some alcohol, not a big deal and we would still have gone with the package if we had been told but we weren't.",0
862,"We were here in the monsoon and were frankly very disappointed. The room was lovely but that was about the only good thing. The service was terrible. One day the house-keeping staff came at around 1 p.m. to make the room and I asked them to come a little later after I left. When I came back at 7 p.m. my room hadn't been made all day. I called them to make the room - they clearly were annoyed about it and did a terribly shoddy job. Some food had fallen on the carpet and they didn't even bother cleaning that up, till I had to tell them quite strongly to clean properly. 
The food was terrible - a lot of stuff which was nearly inedible.
Do not bother staying here ever.",0
863,Location is good. House keeping and baggi services are poor. Reception people are not cooperative. Food varieties are limited but good. A. C. In our friends room was not working properly even after reminder. Very strict about check out time not ready to wait for half an hour.,0
864,I only write when we have to appreciate the hotel team but its the first time its different. Big property but poorly trained people. Checked in and found the room lights not working. The curtains are ill maintained and center table is shabby. The front desk people are not trained to delight guests. This is the difference between an oberoi -taj category and the hyatt lots.. they should ensure proper training of their team. Hope the GM Gaco Le Roux takes note. Mind it we are travelling with kids and infants. All the best to the grand hyatt team.,0
865,"Stayed here for 3 nights with a couple of friends. 

GOOD
The hotel itself is beautifully maintained, clean and wonderfully decorated. It is in an isolated location so you will need to get one of the many taxi drivers touting for your business outside the front gate. There are no other restaurants apart from the hotel options. There is a very small wine shop to the right of the hotel 5 mins down the road. 

The spa was lovely, it had all the amenities. Yami my massage therapist did a stellar job.

The breakfasts were good and had a good mix of traditional Indian and also some fusion twists such as goats cheese, beetroot and mint dosas. The waiters were quick to bring orders & service was good.

BAD
We first checked into the hotel the a/c wasn't working, the bell boy fiddled around with it and then it started working for a bit before it cut out. By the time we figured out the a/c wasn't working it was 2am. Reception sent an handy man but said it needed a new part. At 2am in the morning we didn't necessarily want a handy man to fix our broken a/c. Reception called and asked us to change rooms. After travelling all day that just wasn't reasonable. The next morning they apologised but said given they offered us a room at 2.30 in the morning, we chose the discomfort... Later the Adil the GM came to apologise and offered us massages.

We also paid for club rooms and had access to the lounge. Much to our dismay most of the time there was no food left. On Sunday there was 2 scones and 3 mini cupcakes. We ordered ice teas and half hour later they still hadn't arrived despite following up with the waiters numerous times. There was only one other couple in the club room and they got 6 cups of tea whilst we waited. Super poor service given there was more waiters than customers.

Compared to the JW Marriott Mumbai the service was very inconsistent. No one seemed to care when we told them. Deferring it to the GM to take care of.",0
866,"The vacation time was on so arrived Goa around 3:30 pm but there was no hotel transfer managed by the hotel as there was some communication gap between hotel and their reservation team . So due to their mistake had to wait for almost 25 minutes at the airport in hot summer . Reached hotel no welcome drink offered , went to rooms as we had booked 3 rooms for 4 nights stay , we had booked their bay view rooms which were supposed to be their best rooms but all the three rooms were in the pathetic state , as the walls of rooms were patchy as it required to be coloured properly . The carpets in the room was in bad condition made me tripped couple of times . Bathroom flooring was having black spots as it was was having marble flooring needed to get changed it was damn old and no proper Maintenence was done . In short the rooms were nightmare so called the front desk to change the rooms they showed me three more rooms but all were same . So had to stay in the same rooms as had booked three rooms with them for 4 nights . The hotel garden is very well maintained lots a greenery around and they have a new casino coming up soon so construction work going on in the property area which is not disturbing at all as it is located on the opp side of the guest houses . They have a beautiful frontage of sea which they could use very well if they build a good restaurant looking over the sea but they have not utilised it . There are sleeping loungers to relax overlooking the beautiful sea and greenery of the very well maintained garden . The property I found is little bit secluded from the hustle and bustle parts of Goa , no good restaurants around you have to go to Panjim which is 20 mins away or candolium which is 50 mins away . Overall for me if they renovate the rooms than only I think it's value for money because the room nights over here are not cheap otherwise there are far better options in north and south Goa . I would have given them one star for the rooms but as I would like to mention the staff service is simply superb they will definitely go a extra mile to make your stay as happy as possible I will definitely give them extra point for that . Wouldn't recommend this hotel till they get their rooms renovated . ",0
867,"I was here in April from 21st to 24th, on a leisure trip with friends. it was a mixed kind of feeling there, like property is definitely good, outdoor and indoor pool are well maintained and you can easily say that it is the Hotel's private beach though it is not so. Location is good and they have everything in place as you like it to be but they had the same menu of breakfast with very subtle change which is very hard to detect, cuisine is OK and service is poor what maximum they are offering us is a big SORRY every time.
Out of three night two was nightmare,
21st NIGHTMARE - My rooms glow refused to fade till 2 AM in the morning because master switch was defective and all the lights were on and finally we were asked to shift to another room around 2:30 AM.

22nd NIGHTMARE - was preparing bathtub at around 12 AM when we saw three COCKROACH in the TUB trying to take bath along with me. I have snaps of these unwanted guest where two was washed away and one is relishing the warmth.

23rd NIGHT - finally a goodnight.

Problem - No apology was offered to us during the checkout or in between. There were no personal relationship manager. the services are definitely not up to a five star.
I wish all the good luck to the management and staff there who can easily convert a good property to the best hotel with hard work and empathy.
thank you Grand Hyatt.",0
868,"Didn't tell us the owners were going to have a party for two days which shut down half the restaurants and have an 8 hour pool side petty. Had the audacity to suggest guests went elsewhere for dinner

Tried to put four of us in a double bed ""sorry we are busy"" - and after some simple pushing got a third bed.The manager Adil Canteenwala in particular did nothing despite repeated promises

Airport transfers ""sorry no cars"" despite booking

Kids activities are good and pool service also attentive but that's not enough at these prices",0
869,"I have stayed at several grand Hyatt's around the world and this has been a very poor experience. I booked on points and cash and my rooms where under separate reservations which caused issues on check in. I try and check in early there was no room, but was offered to be able to check in then and there if I upgraded for a fee I said no. 1 hour later the same situation was offered I said no. 2hrs later I was told I have a pool side room and I can check in. Again I was asked if I wanted to upgrade for a slightly less fee, I said no. 15 minutes later after I am checked in I am told I have been upgraded as a curtisy!!!!! This is quite possibly the worst scam I have seen at a hotel. Why was I just not comp'ed at the start for no fee rather than waiting 2.5 hours and getting it anyway, that is poor customer service. In addition it was valentines weekend, a romantic getaway, the hotel should have informed guest that there would be large events happening that included noisy set up during the day all through the grounds, then loud music one night, thumping DJ music the next and fireworks as well. Hardly a relaxing romantic break. In addition to which whilst by the pool on both days there were work men working in two guest rooms noisily and all the furniture was out in front of them strewn on the gardens, nice touch. As for food, Hyatt you need to up your game, the food was bland and poor quality and just mass produced. The restaurant options were poor with poor menus, I am in GOA not even an option for local cuisine. Service was poor as well, we order a drink by the pool, requested an ice bucket for them, we had to ask three times over 45mins to get it, at which point are drinks were warmed and ruined in my opinion in the hot sun. In addition our room was not serviced, our car was not booked for the airport that I requested, subsequently not charged to the room and I had to scrabble for money at the airport to pay the driver. Water ran out in the public toilets as well. This was a terrible experience and a waste of my points and money. I will not be revisiting a Hyatt again, especially in India. If you want to complete for the money you are charging you need to understand the quality of tourism and service in India by the other brands. Its a shame you have a beautiful resort, its just lost amongst the mediocre service and offerings.",0
870,The location is very nice near to the city. The airport pick up took a long time to come. The check in was also medicore.They take you to a separate place for check in but then the person who checks you in goes to the Reception for everything. Might as well check me in at the Reception. There is nothing fancy on making me sit down away from the Reception. The rooms are good. Housekeeping needs to look at the Towels as many have marks on them. The check out was painful. So many people called me to check out and even after confirmation that my check out time is at 2 pm they kept on calling me to check out early. Also the complimentary airport transfers were converted into paid and I needed my admin in Singapore to speak to them to re confirm. I also had an email from the Hotel on complimentary transfers which did not help much. So overall a poor experience at the end. Could have been much better and did not feel that they respect Diamond members here. Will avoid the hotel in future.,0
871,"Arrived at 2pm and had to wait until 3.40pm to get my room after demanding it.....god only knows what time it would have been had i not. Rooms are supposed to be ready for 3pm and not one member of staff offered me or my family a drink but were very quick to bring out there pdq to take payment for my stay. 

Also very misleading package when booking 'Breakfast/lunch/dinner' as soft drinks are only included at breakfast, seems very strange to me in the world of all inclusives where all these aspects are not of concern especially when you just want to relax and enjoy your break.

First night they had a seafood market for dinner which we were informed was an additional cost only to find out the next day it was inculded in our package. After my check in experience maybe they were trying to get more money out of me. 

I am still waiting for managment to contact me to discuss the poor check in service experience but i am not holding my breath. Hence why i am writing this review during my stay and not after. 

My advice is when booking check exactly what is included as i have no idea what my final bill will be.

Dont think ill be back somehow",0
872,"Pros
+ the location
+ the facilities 
+ food

Cons
- service
- worn out stuff in the room (broken weighing machine, used emery board)

The property is massive and beautifully maintained. The location is right by the bay bringing in the calmness of the sea while the waves provide the right rhythm to ur stay.
The food is exemplary. Although we had the breakfast included, we never really got the chance to enjoy due to busy wedding schedule I was there for and the very late nights. The room service food was amazing and the service provided by the F&B staff was excellent.

Now with the Cons.. 
Worst service that I have ever experienced. Being a Guest Relations Manager at a major 5 star chain in London, I expected much more but definitely felt let down. To begin with they have specific policies on photo/video even for in house guests which is ridiculous. Their marketing dept policies vary from their front office and on my wedding day I had to stop my prep and speak to their front office as they wouldn't allow my videographer to enter the property due to their rules when I had already spoken to their marketing team 2months before my arrival.
Secondly even on checkin I clearly mentioned that since I was here for my wedding and the room being allocated in the furthest corner of the property, I would require carts to pick us and drop. I was told that wouldn't be an issue if we called 15mins prior, which was done. Despite of which we were made to wait for 35 mins and on my 3rd call I had a rude employee speaking who had no sense of 5* star service, he kept arguing that since they were 'short of staff' they couldn't provide the cart. Did i just pay for THIS?? And just lik that they downgraded themselves to a whole new level. 
All in all, I wouldn't go to the place again!! Nor recommend it!!!",0
873,"Lovely property, spectacular view, average food, horrendous service. Impolite, unsmiling and disinterested staff is a striking and distinct feature of this property and it's un-missable. The lawn and pool area are lovely and perfect for an evening setting. Rooms are nice. Shut one eye to the food. Shut both your eyes to the staff & service as it is Goa's worst perhaps (safely saying this after having stayed at 20+ properties in Goa). The management needs to understand that scale and size don't make you 5 star and that location works only to a point. How much you pour your heart and how guest-centric you are ultimately decides where you stand and how willing one is to pay you.

Overall just a 2.5/5 place - anything more would be generous. All other options in same price bracket a way better bet.",0
874,"This stay was extremely disappointing. I had booked two rooms, since I was travelling with family and the rooms allocated to me were definitely not up to Hyatt standards. The bathroom was disgusting with worn out marbles along with stains and decay. The carpet was dirty and the coffee table situated in the balcony had coffee/ tea stains from before. I was moved to another room the next day after the duty manager saw the appalling condition of the room. The service in general was below par. The billing experience was awful. I had called the front desk at 9 AM in the morning to enquire if my bill is ready and front desk representative told me that it's ready and I can stop by any-time, however when I stopped by the front desk at 11 AM, I had to wait for nearly 45 minutes to get the bill. I am a platinum with Starwood, Marriott and Hilton with over 150 nights cumulatively in this calendar year as I travel every week for work. This was my first stay at a Hyatt property and definitely would be the last one courtesy of this property.",0
875,"Stayed in the hotel for two days, quite expensive by any standards for an average 4 star resort. check in process was quite dis organized to 30 mins to get the rooms allocated for us. It's an old hotel need significant renovations. Pricing of food and beverages very high by any standard.",0
876,"We booked in the hotel not knowing it was going to be during a festive holiday.We had been given a suite overlooking the main pool. the hotel was full of tourists, who were obviously on some cheap package. the pool was full of loud families, who didnt stop screaming on the top of their lungs, all through the day and way past midnight. we must have called several times complaining, but the hotel didnt maange to stop the rowdy crowd. There was a casino on the premises which had a dress code, but the adults would used the pool fully clothed. Go figure... worst experience ever in a hotel in Goa",0
877,"Have never seen a more deplorable state of a 5 star delux property....the room cushions cupboards taps carpet fridge are all so worn out.... we were given a room in one corner (room 2227) and on opening the balcony one could just see the genrator room with its sound and polluted air disturbing us for our whole stay....repeated request for a change of room did not help....

one would not want to visit a hotel like this for a holiday....",0
878,Poor place to stay.The buffet spread was extremely average with very poor choice offered.Breakfast were mismanaged with erratic availability of spoons.Swimming pool is poorly designed with steps all around leading to enhanced chance of injuries.It is more like the great bath of Mohenjo Daro.One has to be careful with sitting around the pool area in the evening as there are lots of mosquitoes.One may like to carry anti rabies vaccine as there are stray dogs roaming around the campus.Most of the umbrellas were not properly functional.House keeping left a lot to be desired.,0
879,Be warned..the service is pathetic.. Takes ages to deliver and room clearance takes at least one hour and to top it the food bland and tasteless.The reception and checking in is flawless. When u book a room the entire room package is not revealed and u have a surprise of taxed being extra after checking In. Somehow leaves a bad taste... Another two days to go... Let us see...,0
880,Stayed there during a conference .checked into room the door knob wasn't working . Thought I will have a soft drink while I waited for the repair mini bar was locked said I have to pay a deposit so asked them to send a person and collect a deposit . Guy came said only MasterCard ( guess that really can't blame them ) after 15 min a person comes to open the mini bar ( why it couldn't happen simultaneously beats me ) - he opens the mini bar and takes out everything there is in it - asked him then why would I want a mini bar - he says this is his instruction . Speak to reception again they apologise and put the stuff back !!!!! None of The staff smiles or wishes you while you meet them in corridor or open areas - all of them seem morose and the whole hotel gives you that feeling . Beautiful property but lacks a soul and there is nothing nearby . So why stay here . Rooms are good but maintained poorly - balcony opened out to a great lawn and the beach beyond but found couple of stray dogs ???? Doesn't give you a safe feeling . On second day came back to the room at 3 pm - the housekeeping hadn't done anything so called them - they were prompt in coming and cleaning up but one would have expected that it would have been done between 9 and 3 pm,0
881,The hotel is located close to a bay and makes it special. there are special sea activities here. the food is superb. the staff is friendly. there is even a casino here. not to talk about the indoor pool which is fantastic. the room is huge. the one we got upgraded to a bay room was simply magistic.,1
882,"Grand Hyatt is grand in every sense possible! They really live up to the hype that the brand has created in the market. The property is just perfect with lots of open spaces, many activities which can keep you occupied throughout the day, a bay area which gives you the reassurance that you are in goa, an excellent swimming pool setup and a classic pool side bar which serves some great cocktails. The food is awesome across all their restaurants and the rooms are really well designed. Overall a must visit for all those who want to get pampered in Goa!",1
883,It Is What You A Call A Five Star (5*) Hotel And Resort .it Was Our Family Trip And We Enjoyed A Lot Staff Was So freindly and Nice So Each and every Thing They Tell us.it was Clear That They All Were Picked from From Hotel Mangement from diffrent Parts Of Country I will Give 10 out 10 To Them Guys. Know The Room Was Very Very Beautifull And With A Awesome Pool View Each and Every Thing Was Managed .i loved it and Location Of Hotel was very Near Too Panjim and Goa Airport so U can easily Reach Here and We Were Also Having Our Private Veichle so There Was No issue of Parking.and Know We Were Having Buffet brakefast it was Also Very Nice all the variety you can get but I think so There Should be some More Changes from day to day because We Say That the Menu Was Almost Same Always.And One More thing Hotel Should Arrange Some Entertainment In evening because The Entertainment Show Which were Going was More for Foreginors and Less For Indians So These Was All The Feedback and Drawback from Us .It was really really Awesome Trip .,1
884,"The Grand Hyatt, Goa, provides the most relaxing/beautiful environment for a fabulous holiday. We loved every minute of our 7 night stay, wonderful food & cocktails, excellent facilities, a sea view room with large balcony and organised drivers to hire for exploring & sightseeing. It couldn't have been better!!",1
885,Grand hyatt made my wedding night just perfect. Its heaven on earth....the property is huge and the view of the sea was breathtaking. Our stay was excellent and the breakfast was exceptional. Thank you grand hyatt,1
886,This like all Grand Hyatt Hotels is superb with luxurious decor and amenities. Food is excellent and true to India. If it was not 101/2 hours flight time I would come more often. Classy hotel with great food an friendly staff.,1
887,Property is perfectly located at the bambolim bay. Check in process was very smooth. Must appreciate that hotel has considered my requests to make my stay pleasant. Activities in the hotel it self has variety of options. I found Aquasailing and archery very interesting. Pool side area is just amazing. Overall it was an awesome experience staying with Grand Hyatt.,1
888,Good food with wide variety and separate kitchens for intercontinental and Indian food. Scenic location for both restaurants that adds to overall pleasantness while dining at the property. Quite a good experience.,1
889,Great property.... Great food .... food is inexpensive as compared to any 5 star hotel.... Drinks are quite reasonable.... All staff are very helpful.... Got an upgrade.... Located in a bay area..... Not the typical beaches of south Goa.... But access to the beach is good... Children activity area is interesting... Pools are great.... Had a great stay,1
890,The rooms were very spacious with balconies. Lovely bathrooms. The service was brilliant. The access to the bay and the loungers there along with the service provided there was lovely. Lots of activities for my nine year old son. We had a lovely stay and will definitely come back.,1
891,"The Grand Hyatt Goa is a truly wonderful place. The whole place is designed beautifully. The garden is perfectly maintained and it is just a great view to walk through. Also the rooms are always spotless and the room interior is very modern and stylish. There is really not a thing I would change.

But what really made this place outstanding were the people working here. Everyone - from the manager, the chefs, to the waiters - everyone was 120% attentive, friendly and great. The whole team was so open and friendly that we were sad when our trip came to an end, knowing we met such wonderful people! 

If you are searching for a quiet place to relax in your holiday, there is just one thing you should know about the Grand Hyatt before you book...it is THE place to have a wedding in Goa. And that also means, they happen a lot at the hotel. I find that a wonderful experience, especially if you never witnessed an Indian wedding before, like me. BUT...a wedding in India is a crowded, festive and also loud affaire. So you should know that every other day your quiet resort could turn to a giant party ;)

And last but not leat - the food! AMAZING! Never before did I eat such great Indian food every single day. And I can really recommend everything I tried - the quality, as well as the presentation is outstanding!",1
892,This is a big property and well managed. Food and room service is very prompt and staff very efficient. The beach is a 5 min walk from the room and very clean and well kept. Not very crowded. Pool is excellent. Rooms are spacious and well kept.,1
893,"I been in this property for 3 days and I wish I could have stayed longer, I was in a standard king room with plenty of space and a lovely balcony to relax, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was quite big, the beach is like 3mt away from the hotel but it's not very big I actually spend more time in the hotel swimming pool which is amazing, you can do some activities in the hotel like climbing and rope swinging and a small zip line, that have yoga and in the spa you can do group activities which are nice, the gym is very adequate
The staff is super friendly and professional, hsk clean the room very well and room service food was really nice
Overall great place close to rest and chill also is close to goa night clubs if you want to party ",1
894,Nice experience & enjoyed stay Will definitely recommend Good location Near Panjim city Spa experience was very nice Rooms are well equipped with all modern amenities Room balconies have good relaxing chairs with nice sea views,1
895,This is one of the best hotel resort I have ever lived in India...it is not only picturesque but quite relaxing as the sun goes down on the beach ... The guest rooms are well furnished and staff are highly efficient ...overall Amazing,1
896,"Nice hotel, with all kinds of options, great food and a location next to the ocean. You have 7 restaurants and an onside casino. Possible to do scubadiving, volleyball, spa activities of all kind. Huge complex with more than 336 rooms with different view.",1
897,"We had a pleasant stay at the hotel, lots of activities for kids, neat and clean rooms, amazing cocktails and the buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner were all too delicious. The staff are extremely friendly and go far and beyond to meet your requirements. Would highly recommend especially for families with kids all ages",1
898,"We visited with many friends for a wedding event. Stayed in block 4 next to the pool. 

Since it was a group booking, we did not have any hassles in check in as our hosts had already arranged for everything. 

The room was nice and comfortable, decent size with a balcony overlooking the pool. The bathroom was comfortable, spacious. An interesting feature was that the wardrobe opened from two sides so we could access clothes from the bathroom also.

Since the bed faces the balcony, the to is placed on the side of the bed which appears a bit odd but it can be swivelled to a suitable angle.

Room service was good, although a tad slow. Breakfast, lunch & dinner were all fairly good. The grounds are nice and one is almost on the beach. The beach itself is not a swimmers beach and is very small. If you want the full Goa beach experience including shacks etc, you'll have to find another beach. Nearest you new will be at leat 30 mins ( south Goa).

Facilities are good incl the spa and gym. The business office was a bit slow as there was always a line. 

Overall, the experience was nice and I would recommend this hotel for nice relaxing holiday. Also there are not too many other people, crowds around so a bit private.",1
899,"Amazing Property!!!Beautiful view.We had chose bayview room for our stay nd wasn't it amazing or wat.Trust dis place to b kids friendly.Extremely wonderful staff.In total amazing experience.Our stay coincided with my daughter's bday,the guest relation staff Mr Roger was extremely thoughtful for arranging a surprise for my daughter.",1
900,"Room was superb with large bed, silky soft linen, lounge , balcony and stunning bathroom with all the amenities and appliances.
Service was par excellence from the bell boys,service attendants, waiters right up the concierge and managers. Nothing was too much to ask for.Food was dine especially the breakfasts and themed suppers.
The facilities at the hotel are nothing short of extravagance...the numerous pools, variety of games, hammocks, pool bar, beach, gym, casino, jacuzzi etc.

902,"I have stayed for very long periods with Taj, Oberoi , Radisson and Hyatt. However , what distinctly differentiates the scaff from the rice is a property of Radisson brand which is "" Phoenix park inn candolim Goa "" . I planned my anniversary in Goa and asked Club carslon to book me two nights in Goa . Very casually they confirmed my reservation claiming an elite stay in "" Phoenix park inn. Candolim Goa "". Having spoken with Carlson,I though that rest assured it would be superb comparable to all previous stays . Unexpectedly and to my utter surprise that Club Carlson had the audacity to put me in a place which in terms of service can be rated worst than any local motel, staff training like untrained hawkers and on top of that there behaviour with guests absolutely coarse and impolite. Am surprised how can Radisson allow it's association with something of this sort just for a few bucks. I would definitely ask my known colleagues n friends to avoid this hotel and the brand Radisson.
Two days in Goa and only unfortunate part was the stay.",0

Only the staff at break fast was a bit professional .... other wise it was like staying in an unbranded guest house !

would never come back and would never recommend anyone to stay in this property... please cancel your bookings if possible.. there are better options available around",0
906,"Although the property is good but the overall management is very poor. We were travelling as a family with parents who are senior citizens. Through the reviews I came to know that the hotel does not have a lift. So I wrote an email approx 10 days before our arrival to allot us at least one ground floor room if not all. 
We went to the hotel early in the morning as we were already staying in Country Inn ( a much better property... had to shift due to lack of availability)... and requested the reception people to allot a room on the lower floors.. as we were not in a hurry to check in. We were assured that they would do their best. We left the luggage and went for sight seeing and came back around 6 pm... and to our surprise.. we were given rooms on 3rd floor... with the same lame excuses that these has a better view and blah blah... my mother in law could not manage to climb the stairs and once we managed to take her there she stayed in the room for full length of the stay.... missing all the fun...
The people at the reception were so unprofessional... one of the persons asked the waiter to get us a welcome drink on Arrival and he bluntly replied....""de to diya!!!""... and we were astonished to hear that... as we had just arrived!
In the afternoon... when I was trying to make my child sleep.. a group of house keeping staff were cleaning the room next doors and were shouting on the top of their voices. I requested them to speak slow but they did not pay any attention and kept on shouting and calling each other which ultimately made my son wake up and go cranky.
There was no Vallet parking and the person looking after the cars did not know how to drive. We had to move at least 2 cars on our own to take out ours... 
I personally believe that there are better managed properties in Goa at similar price tag... 
Avoid this hotel if possible... and use it at your own risk.",0

908,"This is by far the worst experience in any hotel stay for me so far !

Firstly, hotel is located in a narrow by lane. Only one car could pass. Parking is limited and very tight. They call themselves a 4 star hotel, but they don't provide even a valet ticket. You have ask them for this ! Even 2 and 3 star hotels these days provide valet tickets.

The reception was so dull ! No smiling faces to even greet you, just straight faces to greet you at welcome desk.

They assigned two rooms for us which were I guess located on the third floor and they don't have lifts. Imagine an elderly person having to climb 3 stairs for reaching their room.

Electronic Keys for the rooms were not working. A person was sitting at every entry point who you have call to open the room doors ! 

When we entered the room, the room though clean but the floor was full of sand. Had to ask the house keeping guy to clean it once again.

No privacy tags on any rooms. I told the housekeeping guys specifically not to clean the room as our stuff was lying around in the room when we weren't around however still someone entered without our specific instructions.

And last one is even more hilarious. When I raised all the above issues with the manager, there were 3 people who came up to the room. None of them knew the star rating of their hotel ! One said it's 4 and the other said 3.. basically no one was aware of such a basic thing !!

Point is the stay was horrible. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone unless you don't have a choice.

912,"Substandard food - disappointed totally - non veg choice is minimal - desserts are poor tasting , long minutes of waiting and needs multiple reminders for service at the bar - in fact there was no bartender for 50 percent of the time and it was one guy serving 20 people - not just once but that's the standard , the restaurant was tightly overcrowded like a fish market - Could hardly get to the buffet thru 3 layers of guests , cold food time and again - be it breakfast or main meals , wifi is super slow and breaks up - for a whole day no wifi and no back up , conference room shocker - 3rd floor with NO lift - that's a nasty one when you're there only for meetings , crappy attitude - managers don't oblige or help , to top it all they issue threats. 

The property is 6 mins from the beach . 

The number rooms is not matched by the supporting infrastructure- it's like being in a city with all the towers falling in on your head.

Special thanks to the food and beverage manager Debojit who did a fantastic job of making sure we had a wonderful stay. Thanks also to Satya on reception - my 6 year old loved him and he felt like a friend by the end of the holiday. 
And finally a huge thanks to Soumen - who took care of us thoughout our stay.
We genuinely did not want to leave Phoenix Park and that is due to the warmth of the staff.
We had upgraded rooms and they were perfect. Lovely bathrooms and decent size balconies. A good tip would be to bring spare coathangers.
The gala evening that they put on for new years eve was absolutely brilliant - we had intended to head on somewhere else for midnight but it was so good we stayed.
The food selection was fantastic - we heard a couple of typical brits abroad moaning that they wanted steak and chips - embarrassing for the rest of us.
That was the only downside to this hotel - the amount of brits who should have gone on holiday to Benidorm - they come to Goa for the cheap booze and nothing else - and end up shouting by the pool at 5.30 in the morning. It is a real shame for the hotel but they have a 24 hour bar so there is not allot they can do.",1
917,"A Compact but Complete Hotel!

It was our first stay here, must admit, Staff made it a memorable one.

Constructed in a bylane, this peaceful property has a cool portuguse architecture; you must have that taste to enjoy!

The colourful hotel (yellow and white with accentuated red small building in middle) has a central pool with 24x7 bar and a grill is surrounded by palm and coconut treees that forms the signature style of the building.
Cosy modern rooms with private balconies add to the charm. 

Front office manager Rahul, an excellent professional, made every effort to make our stay comfortable.

The housekeeping staff is outstanding.
Sudip, Ankit, Satyendra from F&B left no stone unturned to make us happy.
A wonderful staff lady (sorry to have forgotten her name) is seen interacting with guests at front office and restaurant over the comfort!
Pool is clean, beds and towels fresh, dedicated pool for kids and plenty of drink choices will keep everyone occupied.
The ala carte beats any famous restaurant like fishermans cove etc in town. 
We had a ground floor room in tower Rosa that boasts biggest balconies, our kid had a great time.

Only downside I felt was no lifts and strong cartel of taxi operators outside that don Pt allow you to have self drive cars and we had to manage the entire 9 days tour (31 Dec 16-8Jan17) on a rented bike; was fun though!

In peak season every Monday is gala dinner. We were part of the great New year gala dinner and 'twas a good show summing up with fireworks to start the 2017 with a bang!

Best enjoyed: Nov-mid Feb!

Location is great, good food, good people, comfortable beds....I say- Go For It people and ""keep it up Phoenix Park Inn""",1
918,"My wife and I have just spent xmas 2016 at the phoenix park inn resort at Candolim North Goa. The hotel is situated down a small narrow track (car width) about 500 mtrs from the main Candolim/Calangute road, This road is packed with restaurants and shops and bars of all types, but because the hotel is away from this road it is generally very peacefull and quiet, The staff at the hotel are all very friendly and virtually all speak good English. The rooms are spacious and well equipped, good sized pool, perhaps not enough sun beds for this size of hotel. The price of drinks and food are reasonable. The large beach is only around 10 minutes from the hotel.",1
919,Lovely clean hotel with staff that could not do enough for us! The air con in the rooms is excellent and you get in room wifi also which is a bonus! The gala night was really good value for money which is on every Monday evening and the chicken lollipops are the best in candolim!,1
920,"Such a great hotel to stay... few min waking distance to Candolim beach... excellent service and such a great smiling staff i am myself from the hospitality industry... it was so relaxing to see boys working during the breakfast at coffee shop always on their toes... rooms are big in size spacious and the balcony adds a delight... though i was at the backside of the hotel but green areas give you soothing eyes... elevator are the missing part... pool and the pool side bar is just awesome i had couple of drinks with live music it was such a wonderful evening. Check in was quick and we were offered welcome drinks on arrival... you can find a guy sitting just outside the hotel porch if you wanted to hire cab, or self driven scooty or car... food will cost you approx 500 to 700 per person if ordered separately... to sum up a very good hotel for stay with superb service.",1
921,"If u r in North Goa and u have budget of 7.5k it is the best place to be . It's well maintained hotel with excellent facilities, good spacious rooms, including good swimming pool. It's in the market place and is in walkable distance from Candolim beach.",1
922,"Excellent hotel very convenient for town and short walk to the fabulous beach. Great service from all the staff especially Harendra who looked after our nice big room. Room cleaned everyday with clean bedding and towels everyday. Buffet breakfast was good. English and Indian choices. Again very friendly staff in breakfast room.

Pool always very busy chairs reserved early every morning by people putting their towels on them not Germans but with such a great beach nearby it wasn't a problem. Gala night very good value and most enjoyable. ",1
923,Very Cooperative and helpful staff. Nice and good place to stay. Breakfast is very good in taste. Manager is very polite and helpful. Hotel arranged taxi for me very fast as I was getting late. Only 500mt away from candolim beach I will definitely stay in this hotel again. Saurabh Gupta,1
924,"Since 2014 , every year I have stayed in this hotel. Now this hotel becomes my second home in goa. Spacious room, delicious food, very friendly and caring staff. Location is very peaceful. U can have vehicle on rent at walking distance. North goa's famous beaches near to the hotel.",1
925,"This lovely hotel is well placed just of the main road in Candolim - down a quiet side street, - nicely managed grounds, small pool and well sized rooms. Try to get one of the rooms overlooking the pool and a superior room, the rooms at the back don,t have a view. The staff are friendly and helpful. Kettle and fridge in room, with free coffee and tea supplied, powdered milk, so easier to go and buy some 'long life' from supermarket. Good range of food at breakfast.",1
926,"Great hotel consisting of several smaller buildings around a charming pool area - a wonderful, relaxing oasis in the midst of bustling Candolim. Staff is amazing; efficient, friendly and serviceminded. Food is also good and drinks fantastic! Rooms are clean, laundry service is reliable, pool service great and reseption service impeccable. Location is great; it is close to the main street with shops, restaurants and supermarkets, and the beach is only about 10-15 min walk.",1
927,"1. Reception: We were made very welcome. Although the check in was not until 12:00 we were allocated our room as soon as we arrived at around 9:00am.Sachin, the bell boy, helped with the bags. We were not happy with our room as it was not facing the pool, this was changed for us as soon as practical- without any fuss.
2 Room: Really nice room with a comfortable bed and balcony .The room was on the second floor and climbing the stairs was a bit of a challenge.Fridge full of drinks and there were snacks. The TV had multichannels. The Wi fI was a bit of hit and miss.
3.. Restaurant: There are no words to describe the efficiency of the staff here thanks to chef Deepak and his excellent team. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The breakfast was good with a wide variety of choices and sufficient to cater for everyones needs. All the waiters, Suman, Parimal, Ronald, Yagindra ( hope i got the correct name) - to name a few, could not do enough for you.Credit also goes to Manager Debujeet and Debu
4. Cleaning : These staff work from early morning to late night to keep the rooms absolutely clean. There is always a smile on their faces. Our special thanks to Soumesh who kept our room spotless. Always with a huge smile on his face. 
The hotel generally is kept clean through out. The only exception, I am afraid, was the pool. The water looked dirty and was most uninviting. To be fair the management were aware of this as the pool was being emptied on our last day and the maintenance team was working late at night to resolve the problem. 
We found the taxi drivers outside a bit intimidating and always hired ones from the main road. 
The music was too loud for our liking.",1
928,"Me and my mate stayed at this hotel for a week from 16th Nov 2016 
Arriving the early hours of the morning we where promptly checked in and shown to our room,unfortunately there was just one (massive ) double bed , we told them that we needed two singles, our fault we should have requested this beforehand, so we said they could sort it the following day,
On waking up our bags were moved for us into a fresh room, lovely and clean, very spacious, with a balcony, very nice shower room , (toiletries hair drier etc) also tea coffee kettle fridge and mini bar
We bobbed into the restaurant at breakfast time and although we didn't eat anything there seemed to be a really good selection of food and plenty people eating ,
Evening time there was entertainment at the side of the pool, and the drinks were very very reasonably priced 
Every member of staff from the people on reception to porters , bar staff, gardeners , security, even maintenance, were polite , always spoke and had a smile for us, 
Don't be put off by the small street that leads up to the hotel ( it actually gives you rest bite from the noise of the traffic) your only one min walk from all the bars etc , and the little shops on that street will give you some good bargains :) ( I got my shirt for the plane journey home from one) 
I'm back in Candolim for Christmas and new year I wish I was staying back at the Phoenix park , but unfortunately had already booked somewhere different 
But I will be staying again without a doubt",1
929,Will be visiting very soon with friends for second trip this year itself. Previous experience was memorable with great hospitality from the staff. Stay was very comfortable felt like home with all the services.,1
930,"What a lovely little resort! Recommend to all. Goa is full of small streets and this hotel is suitably located remotely away from the traffic noise. A perfect place for couples and families. Our room had all amenities, comfortable bed with pool view. This was our first visit to Goa and the receptionist and assistant front office manager went out of the way to assist with our travel plans. We mostly had dinner at the resort and food was always tasty and fresh. Pool was clean and pool bar had umpteen number of cocktails. Thank you Phoenix Park Goa for a memorable stay. We enjoyed our 2 nights in Goa and will definitely stay again.",1
931,"Professionally Managed hotel, in all circumstances... Good room with brilliant F&B Team..Good place to spent some quality time with family..Thanks to entire team for made my stay valuable..Love u guys",1
932,This was a great stay the staff were great especially 'sundip' he made me very welcome and introduced me to some brits.. always nice to have a bit of home on holiday. The rooms were amazing and the staff if I needed anything were quick. Breakfast had plenty of options and was nice. Defo a 5 star hotel.,1
933,"We stayed for 6 days. Hotel staff is excellent. Food was good. All staff were cordial and always came forward to offer service. The hotel has a excellent boutique hotel setting. Landscaping is good. Sitting in the balcony one can enjoy a cool drink while reading a book. 
The location of the hotel is a huge plus. Candolim is just the right place. The other locations we visited were quite a mad house. 
I recommend it to all. Shall revisit.",1
934,"I booked a room in the hotel and it was my second time booking in the hotel. Some staffs were new this time, but they were well-behaved and very helpful. The reception guy had a nice smile on her face all the time, and it's really good! Service was good and the room was clean.
I had to visit a company near by Vasco, and they arranged me a taxi for both going and coming back, which was a great help to me.

They have a nice restaurant too, and the sea foods they serve are truly yummy! I liked the deep fried fish finger so much that it became the part of my daily breakfast in the hotel.

It was overall a nice experience again, and I will choose the hotel the next time also when I will be in Goa. Keep up the friendly and nice service!",1
935,"We had a group at this hotel, the best part is we got all rooms Early check in, and Restaurant food and service is should be appreciated, Special Thanks to Mr.Prakar Gupta & Mr.Dharmender ,Mr.Rahul - Front office Manager& Mr.Debojith - F&B Manager, we really got very good support and timely quality service.... Looking forward to visit in future...",1
936,"3 super names at Phoenix ... Michelle in customer relations and Amit at front desk really made it one of the most special trip for us. 

We planned the Babymoon n was taken care by them just like a family ... I was given room on the ground floor, food n fruits were served in the room to ensure it's not inconvenient for me in this condition.

Way to go Michelle and Amit... you guys are doing a fantabulous job !!",1
937,"My stay was excellent and i got everything what they mentioned in my package. Staff behaviour,Room Neatness, Food everything was good. One suggestion on Swimming Pool maintenance it would be better it could have been cleaned daily basis and overall total stay was pleasant and Thanks for the Phoneix management for made my trip as wonderful. Special thanks to Manoj, Sudip, Ashish(House Keeping) and Anjitha(Receptionist) .",1

",1
946,"When we entered in Phoenix Park Inn we are slightly worried about hotel but when we stayed here after two days I'm really surprise it's really a very good hotel, They cared their guest very politely, the room is very luxurious almost all facilities are available, food is very tasty, because we are RCI platinum member they offered us for complimentary breakfast. 
Best location resorts, Beach is approximately 1.2 km from hotel but due to rainy season there is no Shack, room service is very good, good wifi, all toiletry is available, I highly recommend this hotel for all our RCI members.",1
947,"I was in Goa last month and booked a deluxe room through my tourist guide in Phoenix Inn Resort, Goa. As I heard it is a 4-star hotel so I had some pre-notions about the hotel like I was suspicious of the hospitality and dining there. I reached the hotel at 12 at night and was very tired but the refreshing kokum drink(welcome drink) was the feast started there to make me feel at home. I was surprised by the extremly humble front office service. Now comes to room, it was wonderful, very clean, and was equipped with the every comfort that one needs. The houskeeping department are so good and helping. The view is awesome from the window. The Candolium beach is just 10 minute walk from the hotel so it was an added advantage to choose Phoenix as my residing venue. I stayed 2 night and 3 days there and not a single time the hotel staff gave me a reason to complain. Hotel provide me picka nd drop facility to the airport at odd hours and I can confidently reccomadate the resort to every tourist in Goa.",1
948,"The staffs, managers...the service...the hospitality- all are recommendable, I will definitely recommend this hotel to the visitors in Goa. The facilities, the pool, the food...everything is just great",1
949,"We really had a great stay at Phoenix Park inn Goa. Rooms were clean and well equipped. Complementary Breakfast was superb one can get any kind of breakfast, The buffet Lunch and dinner was fabulous Most important you can easily access taxi and 2 wheeler rental just stepping out the hotel. All the staffs including security, Reception staffs, Room service and restaurants staffs were very friendly and cooperative to all the guests. The location of hotel is in North Goa(Condolim) which is one of the most happening place in Goa. So definitely it will be a great experience with Phoenix Park Inn Resort :)",1
950,"It was a wonderful experience at Phoenix Park Inn. The property is located close to calangaut beach also not far from Candolim & Baga beach. 
Very nice and comfortable room. Friendly staff and Excellent food. 
Overall great hospitality. Will definitely stay at the same place on nxt visit.",1
951,"Just arrived back after spending 3 weeks at this brilliant hotel. It's my second time staying here and won't be my last. 

When we arrived our room wasn't ready but it wasn't a major problem as friends we were with their room was, so we were able to use theirs till ours was ready. 

The staff can't do enough for you and the grounds are spotless. 

The hotel is down a side street off the main road so it's lovely and quiet. 

We had a pool facing room which was so nice and our room cleaner Harendra could t do enough to make our stay as pleasant. 

I do feel sorry for some staff the way some English tourist speak and treat them. They think they're their slaves. Moaning because they could t bring them a pot of tea quick enough when u could make it in a cup. 

An excellent hotel in a great location.",1
952,"We booked the phoenix park & after reading some of the reviews we were optimistic, 
BUT I can honestly say i do not know what some people want, 
This hotel is Great Value for money, perfectly situated no traffic noise. Its spotless clean, The staff are always smiling friendly & happy to helpful in anyway they can. The food was delicious. 
We had a 14 night stay nothing was to much trouble. The room was cleaned daily with & bottled water - tea & coffee making facilities replenished daily, there was also a Fridge, Cable TV, 2 ceiling fans & air con & wifi in our room ALL FREE. NO upgrade needed. 
The down side only small balconies & only around 28 sunbeds which were full before 8am, 
( this did not bother us as we went down to the beach shack & spent the day there) If we wanted a lazy day. 
Before we went to Goa everyone was telling us its only toast for breakfast, They were wrong as at the Phoenix Park we got everything Eggs Boiled, scrambled, fried, Omelette (ham onion tomato cheese) etc - poached, all made to how you like it, Bacon, cereal, fruit, porridge, toast, Jams- honey, Indian Breakfast, also full menu for the rest of the day & room service if required. the bar was well stocked & nice & clean, not 24hrs anymore though because of complaints ( Not the staffs fault or the hotels). 
I would Recommend The Phoenix Park to anyone thinking of going to Candolim & I would definitely go back without a shadow of a doubt.
A big Thank You To All The Staff At Phoenix Park.",1
953,"Stayed at the phoenix park from 28 Jan to 8 Feb can't complain at all. Staff were very helpful even when there was no teaspoons at breakfast. Good position a short walk from the beach, and the town. The taxi drivers outside the hotel were a bit intimidating but a firm no thanks done the trick. Candalim it's self is a very busy place changed a lot in 11 years since we were last here, found some of the local people were quite rude as if they resented us travellers. But over all had a very nice time. A big thank you to the staff of the phoenix park for a very nice stay.",1
954,"Just came back home. We had wonderful 2 weeks in this great hotel.
Location is very good, no traffic noises from the main street.
Hotel staff is one of best I have ever met. They will do everything for you,
nothing is impossible.
Been in many places all around Goa for many times and I can tell you this is brilliant.
House cleaning works, room service is good and fast.
Very good renowated room. Wi-Fi works all around.
Next year again.",1
955,"Just returned from a 2 week stay at the Phoenix Park Inn and can honestly say we loved it. The rooms are very nice and spacious, albeit the bed was just too hard for me to sleep but on telling the receptionist next day I had a lovely mattress topper put on which was lovely. Breakfast was really good, plenty to choose from although you do have to order your eggs cooked any way and ask for bacon. The gala night is excellent and the selection of food is vast. We found everyone really helpful and friendly, a massive thank you to our lovely housekeeper Sumesh who kept our room beautiful, Thank you so much to Smedha in reception for all your help. The hotel is in a perfect location just down a small side street so away from all the hustle and bustle and noise of the main road, perfect for shops and bars and just a 10 minute walk from all the beach road shops and bars as well. Now if I have one gripe it has to be the pool area, Its not massive so doesn't has a lot of sunbeds so it really does my head in when people are still claiming sunbeds at stupid o clock times in the morning putting their towels or books etc on the beds and then disappearing to the beach or shops for 3 or 4 hours then just saunter on back and claim the beds. I would however definitely stay again and am looking to book for next February, loved the place.",1
956,"Arrived by taxi in the small hours and was quickly checked in by the officiant reception staff that were on at 2am in the morning, a guy from reception took our bags to block 2 as we followed, first impressions of the room were ok though the balcony was small but ok for 2 people to sit out and chill which I did with the help of the fridge bar till 4am, bed was a bit hard but ok, room was cleaned every day and clean towels privided,the bathroom was ample with endless hot water for showering, the breakfast spread was OK and always ordered an omelette as I went in, there were other dishes and plenty of fruit and cereals. I will say one of the good things about the hotel is that it is constantly being maintained and cleaned also is that it is about 100 metres from the main road so you very rarely here any car or bike horns that dominate India, beach is a 10 to 15 min walk but if you can't be bothered there is always the sound of someone saying ""taxi"" as you walk out of the hotel, I would certainly stay here again and would recommend others to give it a go.",1
957,"I was very impressed with this hotel and could hardly find any faults. If I had to be picky then all I'd mention is the lack of sunloungers and chairs at the pool area, although the pool is not a huge size and January is a popular time for holidaymakers. At breakfast make sure you place your order for an omelette or eggs to your liking with one of the waiters as there isn't an area to queue and if you want bacon just ask. All staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay and as it's down a side road you don't hear the noise from the main road. Our room was spotless and we were given water and toilet roll every day. I'd like to give a special thank you to Chandan, the housekeeper who works really hard and asked every day if our room was ok and if we'd like it cleaned. There's a small kids' splash pool but otherwise this hotel is suited for adults. I'd definitely stay here again.",1
958,"Just returned from Phoenix Park after a two weeks stay we were a party of Six adults. We have visited Goa many times and I have got to say this is the best hotel we have stayed in. All the staff were pleasant and helpful our room was cleaned daily clean bedding and towels+two bottles of water.We didn't upgrade we had a kingsize bed a flat screen TV mini fridge, kettle and tea and coffee.Breakfast was good offering Indian food, eggs toast juice tea and coffee
On our last day we were going to pay to keep a room on but we were given a room at 6pm for 2 hours so we all could shower and change
The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the beach and is close to shops and bars
We would definitely use this hotel again ",1
959,"Just returned from another stay at Phoenix Park Inn. I cannot rate this hotel any higher. Really comfortable, clean and friendly. Breakfast, food and drinks are great. Hotel room really comfortable, air con good, complimentary bottled water, tea/coffee daily in room. Excellent cleaning all over the hotel, lovely clean towels and bedding daily. The hotel has been refurbished during 2016 and I therefore think that all rooms including standard will be of good quality. One noticeable difference to year prior is that staff are asking for comments and checking on the comfort of your stay throughout, a good service as if you are unhappy about anything at all it will be dealt with quickly. Manager generally walks around all the Hotel and grounds checking that all is in order. We stayed over xmas and new year, did not stay in for the new year gala but wish we had of done after hearing other guests comments about the event. It both looked and sounded amazing. The staff worked so hard on this event in preparation and the tear down to restore all areas of the hotel ready for breakfast serving on new years day. If we had not already made prior arrangements with friends we would have stayed in for the Gala New Year and will surely take part next year. Well done Phoenix Park Inn and we look forward to seeing you again in December 2017",1
960,"i stayed @ Phoenix Park inn By Radisson in November 2016 on my first anniverssary,
i bookd a premium room but hotel gave me a complimentary upgrade to newly renovated Deluxe room. Room was very great, big in size,, nice decoration. new bathroom... but without bathtub or Jacuzzi 

overall hotel is very nice with a great pool and separate pool for the kids breakfast was great with many options like parantha ,, poori bhaji,,, live dosa.,, live omellete of ur choice and many more things that a 4 star property offers.. 

overall it was a great experience.. will surely recommend everyone for the hotel as its not much far away from the most happening calangute beach,, just 4 km..",1
961,"Awesome place to stay , value for money and staff is very cooperative, food is good , located very near to happening market and candolim beach. Overall good experience and I recommend people to choose this resort who wants peaceful stay and happening nearby",1
962,Had a great stay lots of choice for breakfast English or Indian will defiantly go back staff nothing to much trouble lovely people need moskito smokers around pool area at night lovely hotel entertainment most nights,1
963,"We have stayed in candolim on 6 occasions over the last 14 years and we were very pleasantly surprised by the Phoenix Park Inn
The room was a standard double with a very modern (by Goan standards) shower room.
The room had been re modelled last season and the paint was fresh and bright.
The bed was a super king size and very comfortable.
The hotel overall was clean and well kept. It was a 10 min walk to the main beach and 5 mins to the main road where shops and restaurants were situated.
Breakfast was served in a large airy restaurant and was buffet style with both Indian and continental choices were on offer. Eggs, any style and bacon were cooked to order.
Tea making facilities were in the room as was the hairdryer.
We had a large open to the air balcony ( we were on the top floor) and it was lovely to sit out with a drink before we went out in the evening.
Typically the view from the balcony was lovely if you sat and looked straight out at the palm trees with a glimpse of the sea in the distance. But don't look down as it's the usual view!! Not quite so lovely. Not all the rooms had such lovely balconies but they all had one or a terrace.
The pool and outside bar area was very pleasant and clean and the staff all very helpful, polite and cheery.
The staff on reception were also very helpful and accommodating.
Can't emphasises how happy we were and we would go there again.",1
964,"Here for a month, little oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Candolim! Nice pool and ample room to chill. The staff are very friendly and rooms are of superior quality for.Goa. believe me I have stayed all over in the 14 years that I have visited this area.can"" fault it for what you pay. Prices for drink and food are the same as outside. Will definitely stay here again in the future.",1
965,We stayed in This hotel for 4 nights and the ambience and staff were great!! Breakfast Quality was average for an Indian taste. But the rooms were neat and clean and the hospitality was great. We would love to come back to this hotel.,1
966,"Though we just stayed there for a day(as we didn't get a reservation in the lemon tree which is close to this hotel) we felt it was nice. The front desk people are not very cooperative, they didnt even offer us another room when we didnt like the room, the room was small... anyway on the whole the facilities were nice and the entire staff except for the front desk guys were smiling and cooperative... i would suggest you to please see which room you are booking before booking it, ask them to share a pic... yes they did help us take our luggage to another hotel in the end... so ya it was a good place...",1
967,"Having recently returned home from our stay at the Phoenix park, we have to say that this has to be in the top ten in the candolim area. We have stayed at a few other places in Candolim but this was the best yet . Staff are forever helpful and polite at all times . Grounds are well maintained,as are the rooms. Breakfast has a great choice of both Indian and continental dishes all very good. 
Would highly recommend this great hotel, even the walk from the main road is closer to 200 yards rather than 300. 
Altogether great value for money !",1
968,"We stayed b&b which was very good! The food looked lovely on the gala evening! 
We had a refurbished room which was really nice! We have been told they are standard with Thompson but by request with Thomas Cook. The room was cleaned daily with fresh towels and a supply of bottled water!! Definitely recommend and stay there again!
The young man who cleaned our room (5410) was lovely!",1
969,"It was our wedding anniversary to planned to visit Goa this year, we wanted to stay in North Goa so this was the best fit which suited us, the property is bit old design but is very good, rooms were quite good and equipped for all needs, it has a central pool but it was not that clean and maintained as it should have been, the candloim beach is walk able and you also get bike on rent from outside hotel, calanguate and baga beach are also within reach of 15 min, breakfast served in morning is good but options are limited, but if you are looking for good nice property in north goa than you can always consider this.",1
970,"stayed at this hotel over new year for 2 weeks the rooms are spacious and clean. a big thank you to ganesh our cleaner . the best a/c ever. free wi fi too. fridge in room,kettle with free coffee and tea bags, breakfast was good grounds are kept nice. hotel made a real effort for new year it looked lovely .so if you want a nice hotel not far from anything stay at this hotel but reminder you are in goa we will be back again this year same dates",1
971,Spent three weeks at phoenix park over Christmas and new year hotel was just fine found all the staff friendly and helpful the lad that cleaned our room done a great job everyday the one issue we did have was when my wife caught the security guard trying to put the hotel cat into a plastic bag to dispose of it. She stopped this happening spoke to the manager who I must say was a very approachable man and ask him if it was ok to take the cat to a cat sanctuary to be rehomed. We did this and now the cat will have a happy life. I would definitely stay at phoenix park again,1
972,"Rooms with pool view were great! very clean and well kept premises. The house staff were always smiling prompt and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. They went out of their way to accomodate our large family for dinner at their restaurant. They helped with room moves when they had better rooms available.

I would have given them five stars however a teenager in our group was injured quite badly by protruding screws at the bottom of their pool. The staff did not immediately fix the problem so another guest went in and tried to fix the screws in the pool as other children were also playing in the pool. A doctor was called who arrived within an hour. We had to take the child to an operating theatre for X-rays and to be stitched up by an orthopedic surgeon. With complaints, the resort said that they fixed the screws in the pool 2-3 days later. 

Despite this grave incident, it is a great resort, we would visit again. Their pool valve needs regular maintainance, so watch out for that valve. Otherwise you will enjoy your stay.",1
973,"We stayed at this hotel over christmas and new year the room was very spacious and clean thanks to our cleaner Harendra who always had a smile and a welcome and always asked if the room was ok.The breakfast room was large and had a variety of foods available the waiters were very attentive and were willing to take your order for eggs bacon sausage etc, the two gala dinners we had were ok i am glad we did'nt have to pay for them as they were free to Thomsons guests.The hotel is in a quiet residential street but this seems to be overlooked by the hotel owners the pool bar which was close to our room served drinks some times until 05:30 to boozy Brits who had no respect for other guests by shouting swearing and singing songs,i like a drink as much as anybody but always behave and would have spoiled the sleep of the other guests which included families. I think the hotel should address this problem and maybe use the security guard who is employed there.This was the only blight on what was a very enjoyable holiday I would possibly return to this hotel but in a room away from the pool bar.",1
974,"We spent 3 weeks over Xmas here and enjoyed our stay.
The hotel is in a good central location and the grounds are well kept.
Our room was large overlooking the pool with very effective A/C and cleaned daily to a good standard. 
The pool area wasn't very big and had the sunbed hoggers. It didn't bother us as we spend our days at the beach shacks.
The only negative was that the pool bar was open 24 hours. This wasn't a problem for the first 2 weeks but for the week after Christmas there was guests shouting, singing and generally been loud at the bar until 3.30 - 4am which was very close to our room. Also I woke up one morning to sit on the balcony to be greeted with a ring side view of one guest fighting and swearing with another and having to be restrained by a number of staff. Not what we want to see on holiday!
It's a really nice hotel but probably wouldn't return whilst there is a 24 hour bar operating.",1
975,"Staff very friendly and helpful ,room very clean and recently updated, 10 min from beach everyone in hotel spoke, mainly English tourist's, overall brill holiday,only slight problem was mozzies at night round pool area,",1
976,"We (2 families of 2 daults & 1 child each) returned last weekend from Goa after a 3N/4D stay at this resort. Overall we had a very good vacation & hence am going to overlook minor deficiencies, but rather look at the bigger picture around complete hospitality solutions that the resport provided. And the star of the place was the staff - housekeeping, restaurant, front desk...every one that we interacted was very helpful & courteous. The Candolim beach is around 10 mins walk from the property (there was no shuttle pickup/drop to the beach from the hotel, so plan as such) & plenty of restaurant options for all budgets on the Candolim-Aguada main road. Pleasant stay",1
977,"Stayed for two weeks 02/12/2016 to 17/12/2016 two Adults
Room 2204
I upgraded to a superior room before travelling, 
The room was spacious and well fitted but in need of a bit of TLC, two ceiling fans and air con made the room very comfortable, could have done with more drawer space, but we managed.
Bath room was adequate (sink leaked but was fixed within 10mins)
clean towels every day if requested, two bottles of water supplied every day, balcony not suitable to sit out (a bit on the small side)
Room service very good but could leave the cleaning till late afternoon, a word with the cleaning lad resolved the problem.
Meals
We only had B&B, 
Breakfast was o/k, their was more choice if you wanted Indian, but there was enough choice for us.
Any type of egg, streaky bacon if requested,sausage?, toast cereal and the usual beverages.
Bar service good even if a bit slow at times (your on holiday)
Pool o/k,needed cleaning properly every day, only part cleaned some days, plenty of sun beds and towels.
Monday night Gala around the pool not to be missed, food was stunning.
Staff
Could not fault any of the staff, they were all very helpful in all matters.
All in all a very enjoyable holiday with a good hotel. Good price, good service, hotel needs a bit of TLC but your in India.
Before you book any trips via your holiday company check the local tour organizers they may just save you a few Rupees(we used Johns travels, you must do the House boat trip,",1
978,"i have stayed at this hotel 3 years each time at christmas, I had amazing room 4003. i have to question hotel managementover a kitten at this hotel named it phoenix every morning came for a fuss and some milk. The security guard was told to catch the kitten and dispose of it kitten was squilling a guset named debbie saw the security guard which should be sacked hold it by its tail stuffed it into a plastic bag and shoulved it in a laundry van , debbie ran down stopped it and set it free, spoke to management they did not care any one going please ask were the cat is black and white, i can not stop there any more, i would ask every one to avoid this hotel",1
979,"The hotel is located off the Candolim Calangute stretch. It's a good 10-15 minutes from the beach. The rooms are very good, great decor etc. However, there isn't much to do in the hotel apart from a swimming pool. Overall, its a decent hotel but you can get beachside properties for the same price.",1
980,"We stayed here for 14 days, it was a lovely hotel, the rooms were very nice,spacious,has a fridge, and a safe for peace of mind,the bathroom was also spacious and the shower was perfect.we had bed and breakfast which had a good choice of food to suit all, the staff were all friendly and waited on you hand and foot if that's what you wanted.the only letdown really was the swimming pool as there were only 26 sun beds available at the time there are roughly about 150 rooms at the hotel so a few more sunbeds might have given us more of a chance, and we were told by other guests that pool was too cold anyway, the beach in candolim was fantastic,the shacks on the beach that were run by the local people had a good choice of menu for food and drinks, and they always liked a little chat,there were dogs and cows wondering the beach but if you left them alone they were ok.there are plenty of bars and restaurants which are only a five minute walk from the hotel, and the beach is about a ten minute walk so that was good.we did have money problems due to a change in their currency as we couldant get any money out to spend at the bars and shops which I believe is still going on.",1
981,"I arrived a few nights ago late at night and received warm welcome by all. Shown to room and enjoyed great hospitality in dining room at breakfast. Few minor issues such as hot water and to quicky sorted by maintenance (both my ignorance not the hotel fault). Day 2 small problem with window closer...Harry in charge of housekeeping dealt with it fantastically well, room is beautiful, and guys looking after luggage to facilate the move were so gracious.",1
982,"Just returned after a very good two week stay at this hotel. On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were very pleasant & had a very quick check in . We were allocated room 2302 which was a basic room but was very clean & quite modern for Indian standards & included flat screen tv, kettle , fridge & a hair dryer , plus a safe for a deposit of 10 which was refunded when you checked out. The dining area is very good with plenty of staff around to help you & the food was pretty good , & you must do the Gala night buffet ( about 7 a head ) the food was excellent. The bar is open 24/7 , but keep a check on your bar bill, pay it off EVERYDAY to many people were getting charged twice for drinks this was,nt the bar staffs fault but the receptions staff who weren't cancelling the bill.
The hotel has a very small pool area so most people go to the beach which is about a 15 minute walk, we could not use the pool as it had a filter problem & was a bit off putting. On a night time around the bar make sure you use plenty of mossie spray .But over all a very good hotel which we would return too.",1
983,"We stayed in this hotel for two weeks and enjoyed our stay very much. It is in a decent location in Candolim, within walking distance of most restaurants and bars. also it is just far enough from the main street not to suffer from the noise of a multitude of motorbikes,taxis and buses with their constant pipping of horns and has taxi available outside. It is part of the Park Inns chain which itself is owned by Radisson hotels.

The hotel has rooms in separate blocks and are good quality. They have a large double or twin beds, tea and coffee making facilities,minibar, free bottles of water every day, air con a decent bathroom/walk in shower.and a balcony.
The location of our block was just down from the pool area which made it quieter but made the balcony a waste of time as it was opposite another block and always in the shade - if this is a requirement then it is wise to contact the hotel directly to ensure you get a pool view.
The pool area/bar was a nice place to be. The area gets plenty of sun. if it gets too hot, as the sun moves across, parts get slightly cooler so you can move around.

Unfortunately, having said that, when we visited the beach shacks were not open owing to licence delays which encouraged more people to stay by the pool. This meant that sunbeds could be at a premium, generally there aren't enough but with space for more generally lacking, it's a situation that is hard to improve, Our second week was better as more people went to the beach so it wouldn't normally be an issue.

Staff were great, very friendly and attentive. reception staff were helpful, pool bar staff very friendly and our room cleaner was very creative with his towel models!

I recommend the hotel - it has the odd issue but not serious ones, and would return.",1
984,"Great hotel staff were wonderful, especially Suedip on the bar he was so good at his job 
The hotels picture do not do the hotel justice 
It is spotless and located in a great position.
The food was very good and the pool was cleaned everyday
Only thing was there wasn't enough sunbeds",1
985,"Just need to inform holiday makers who are going to Goa and staying at the Phoenix park Inn resort, please be aware that if your flight is the 3-15 pm from Manchester you will arrive at the hotel approx 7-30 am but you won't be able to get into your rooms till 2 pm in the afternoon that is a six and a half hour wait. I don't blame the hotel because this is the hotel policy, but I do think that holiday makers should be informed by Thomsons so you can make a decision on whether to fly at that time or not",1
986,"Located at candolim road, opposite lemon tree hotel. We had booked a premium room and it was nice and comfortable with a private sitting area with pool close by. Breakfast is nice and adequate and the staff is courteous. Within walking distance you get quality restaurant and supermarts. Beach is walking distance around 500m. Candolim is the best place to stay in this area and has the best places to eat. Overall a nice and pleasant stay. ",1
987,"I don't know why people complaint about staying in Goa, what I believe is, Goa is not there place to be spent in a room. The hotel is worth staying. Nice rooms with pool view and clean washrooms. Very near to the main road, where you can visit all the popular restaurants.. Breakfast spread is decent, not best.",1
988,"Most friendly and helpful receptionist ever, so lovely and great first impression of hotel. Couldn't have been more sweet, giving me directions to a function I was attending along with a helpful map, ensuring parking in car park and facilitating an early check in. If nothing else had gone right with hotel this lady ensured I would have left with a good impression. Fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional, and I don't give praise lightly. It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service .. restaurant where we had dinner. Food was beyond good and great value for money and service in both places attentive and efficient. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable. I could go on but suffice it to say I was very pleased with my stay, and although short and sweet this time, I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.",1
989,this property is situated near to the market and food hub and walking distance from the beach too. staff is courteous and property is tooooo good with a nice rooms. lot of variety in Breakfast and day to day activity is also a fun.,1
990,"This is the 2nd visit to hotel. We booked a pool view room through thomsons, last year was very quiet at night but it seems that they now serve drinks until 3am at the pool bar, not once but most night we were kept awake by the noise. My advice to anyone who has booked a pool room to change it, unless you are a very heavy sleeper you won't get any!!!!! Breakfasts are not brilliant. Although the hotel is nice lack of sleep is not.",1
991,"the hotel is nice , at the reception i thought that i made a mistake booking this hotel , there wasn't any lift at the hotel so had to climb 2 floors but after entering the room i was amazed , the room was very spacious and clean , its newly renovated but i was able to spot that the hotel is very old . my stay was worth the money i booked the room in august for November 16th and got one room at around 4000 per night , overall my experience was very nice .",1
992,"Hi All , we stayed at Park Inn in October for our anniversary , we were 2 couples .
We enjoyed the hotel stay overall . Initially the room assigned to us was in a block where some maintenance work was happening , painters were all around . When we shared the feedback with the hotel , the front desk lady was kind enough to change our room . Our new room was fantastic & had an amazing pool view . Staff was very courteous & helpful . The steward who served us at the restaurant was very nice . Breakfast spread was average & the quality of food definitely needs improvement . There was improvement after sharing our feedback with the staff , however this needs some more improvement . The pool is beautiful & we really had a good time there . The staff decorated our room beautifully for our anniversary . Loved everything about the hotel except the food .",1
993,"If you are looking at spending quality time in some of the best beaches in North Goa, Candolim is the place to be and Phoenix Inn is good choice to organize your stay.

Good:
Service and courteousness of the staff deserve a special mention. Big thank you to them!!
Swimming pool is good with a poolside bar available as well.
Prompt Room service.
Commendable Breakfast Buffet spread with North and South dishes included.
Close proximity to several beaches including Candolim & Sinquerium. Popular beaches like Calangute, Baga and Anjuna are all within 10km radius. Aguada fort is about 4km away.

Average:
There was renovation work carried out in one wing which restricted the balcony usage. Hopefully this is something that may finish soon and pose no further hindrance
Breakfast buffet tends to be chaotic at times. The management can certainly think of better management of the same. 
Overall food quality at the restaurant(Chapora) was good but not great and menu pricing was slightly on expensive side.There are multiple restaurants available in and around the restaurant offering equally good if not better food. 
Road connecting the resort and main-road is dim-light.",1
994,"Stayed here for a week as part of downtime for a 3 week trip to India backpacking . I read some of the reviews here and wonder if people stayed in the same place . Our room was lovely fresh towels , soaps ,robes and water were provided everyday and the room was made up every time we asked our friendly chamber guy to do so usually at a time we were out . Breakfast was very good plenty of variety provided with western and Indian choices galore . The biggest compliment goes to the staff throughout the hotel they couldn't do enough to make your stay comfortable and were courteous to a fault after a few days we were dreading going home . My only criticism was we requested an airport pick up which was offered by the hotel and this failed to arrive after discussing this with Michelle at the front desk we were provided with one for the return leg of our journey . This place is close by to the local supermarket and restaurants a short walk away . The beach is only a few minutes away ,it's brilliantly located . I'd recommend a stay and have done to anyone .

995,this resort is in one of the quiet place of north goa in candolim. Its a great value for money. Rooms are neatly furnished and new. staff are very courteous. breakfast is g ood. the beach is just 500 metres from the resort. This is a wonderful beach where one can spend entire day. there are many bar and restaurants nearby too.overall a nice experience. thoroughly enjoyed my goa stay there.,1
996,A nice hotel excellent location for walking to shops restaurants and beach. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms good size and cleaned daily. Restaurant on site excellent good choices . Good pool and pool bar. Not a large complex so great for kids to play on the pool.,1
997,"Resort is right in the heart of Candolim.Restaurants, beaches and shops are all easily accessible from here.our stay was comfortable for three good nights...the breakfast spread was good but not so great.few items were not cooked properly.and same items were repeated everyday...the staff should learn to manage the crowd swarming around the buffet table...and also change the menu to suit the guests... overall it was satisfying...pool was clean and beautiful.room was big enough and maintained well...service was really quick..worth every penny spent here....did not try lunch and dinner at the restaurant as we managed it outside....do try phoenix inn to enjoy ur goa vacation",1
998,"I had read reviews on TripAdvisor and decided to book this Hotel.

I must say, that the experience turned out to be very good. The Hotel is a fantastic place to stay for the middle income family, and more so for people who are travelling alongwith families. It has a nice cozy swimming pool (and one for kids too) surrounded alongwith a small park, kids just love it! The food is awesome, with a complete meal provided. The location is perfect, with all major beaches of the North very close by...........It has famous properties such as the Taj Resort and Vijay Mallya's bungalow nearby.

The rooms are again..........just perfect......it had a plasma television, controlled air conditioning, clean / perfect washrooms,etc. however I did make sure that I book the best of the rooms and confirmed with the Hotel Front Desk umpteen number of times, that I was given the best of the rooms

If you are travelling to North Goa, this is the best place to stay!

Please note that the travel date is June 2010.",1
999,Stayed there for five days with family and friends . While the initial rooms alloted were not that great however the same same were changed once brought to the notice of staff. This place is close to candolim beach - 5 min walk from the hotel. This place is close to other important places like augda fort / beach as well. Must say that the hotel staff is very helpful and supportive. This resort provides you value for money.,1
1000,"Awesome place to stay! The experience here was the best for me. It is located near CANDOLIM BEACH. Yes, it's not near the beach, but that is pretty evident from all the sites that it has been listed on. It isn't one of those hotels which have 'beach resort' in their name but are located in the centre of the town. The things that I loved about the hotel are as below... Smooth check-in and check-out process. Polite & courteous staff (Mr. SATTU & TEAM) All the staff in the hotel that I interacted with were very polite and always helpful. Ambience The ambience of the hotel, whether it be the lobby or the room was really good. The rooms are spacious, neat and clean and so is the lobby. The food was amazing. The buffet breakfast we had was like a complete meal with everything on The menu that one can ask for. We opted for a buffet dinner after we tasted a couple of dishes on the first day and were impressed with the chef. 

There is some minor issue with the BATHROOMS, needs repairing issues else thngs was great.

The only issue with the hotel is TRANSPORTATION - Hotel doesnt own taxis so they hired/provide the local ones. Drivers are not in proper dress, car was in bad condition, rude and they shows tantrums as well. I guess HOTEL MANAGEMENT is lacking this issue they should own atleast 2 -3 taxis IN the name of the hotel which gives comfort level to get into the car at the airport. We only got a good taxi and driver while dropping means end of our tour.
Else everythng",1
