# Artificial-Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence(AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines. 
These processes include acquiring information from large set of data and processing it further 
for decision making. This repository, specifically, include various hands on, on both 
Natural Language Processing and Computer vision(Emphasizes much on the latter).

## Natural Language Processing
 
Deals with interpreting human(Natural) Languages. The various major components which I would 
love to pursue are as follows:

```
	Sentiment Analysis
	Machine Translation
	Text Summarization
	Information Extraction
	Text Auto correction
	Question Answering
```	

I have started with sentiment analysis on multiple dataset, using various libraries in 
R programming and Python.

## Computer Vision

High level information extraction from digital images and videos are very much required 
for being an acumen in artificial intelligence. Following are the break downs which are essential 
for implementing computer vision:

```
	Image Classification
	Image Detection
	Image Recognition
	Face Detection
	Face Recognition
```	

I have started with sentiment analysis on multiple dataset, using various libraries in 
R programming and Python.
